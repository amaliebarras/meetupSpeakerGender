"<p><b>**PLEASE NOTE THAT WE'RE MEETING AT OPEN SOURCE COWORKING THIS MONTH AND NOT BUFFALO BILLIARD'S!**</b></p> <p><b>Securing Applications Without Compromising User Experience<br/></b></p> <p><br/>Software is typically developed with the end user in mind. As software developers, we go to great lengths to ensure that users can have a seamless experience. However, allowing users to conveniently access their application allows attackers the opportunity to attack users with just as much ease. The eternal struggle that designers and developers face is striking a balance in design and security in order to not compromise the user but optimize his/her satisfaction. This talk will explore some practical strategies that can be implemented in order to improve the security posture of most applications without compromising on the user experience.</p> <p>

<b>Speaker bio:</b> David Vo is a senior consultant with nVisium’s Application Consulting practice. His specialties include application pen-test, source code reviews, and vulnerability analysis, including using fuzzing to find software vulnerabilities.

"<p>Guess what, y'all! November is one of those lucky months where we have a full 5 Tuesdays! You know what that means: it's time to get together, enjoy some frosty beverages, and visit in the time-honored tradition of #BeerSummit.</p> <p>This month we're meeting on the east side at The Dog &amp; Duck Pub. This is the new(ish) location over off of Webberville Road and not the one by campus.</p> <p>New to Austin or haven't heard of a #BeerSummit? They started as a friendly way to avoid the never-ending rabbit hole of Twitter discussions. After three or four replies back and forth on the same subject, someone could propose a #BeerSummit and all discussion had to stop. You couldn't start back up again until everyone had a pint (ale, beer, root beer, water, didn't matter) in their hands sitting around the same table. They've evolved into a simple way to gather the community to talk tech without a schedule.</p> <p>Swing by for as long as you'd like and buy pint for a friend old or new!</p>",Refresh Austin (Web Design & Developer Meetup),5th Tuesday #beersummit: November Edition,1480467600000

But how do you scale a codebase, product, and engineering team while developing applications in Python _securely_ without hiring a bunch of appsec experts? This talk will discuss some common frameworks and pitfalls in Python application security, discuss some of our experiences at Duo building security into a Python SDLC, and give an overview of our in-house Python static analysis framework (to be open-sourced RSN).""</p> <p>Jon is the co-founder and CTO of Duo Security, responsible for leading product vision and the Duo Labs advanced research team. Before starting Duo, Jon was a self-loathing academic, completing his PhD at the University of Michigan in the realm of cloud security.

"<p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>We've had some really cool presentations at previous meetups this year, but we don't have as much time to socialize and chat.  For our September meetup, I thought it would be interesting to take a more ""unconference"" style, where we can talk about our current projects, ask questions of the group, and learn from each other.  If anyone wants to do a brief show &amp; tell at the beginning or the end, the podium and projector are open!  I'd like to kick things off by asking for volunteers (especially those new to the group) to come forward to introduce themselves, and talk about their current forays or projects in Python.</p> <p>There seems to have been some confusion about location, so to clarify: the meetup will be at the Atlassian office, and not at the Capital Factory.</p> <p>

"<p>In this interactive presentation, Andrew will discuss the pros and cons of planning, obtaining, and maintaining intellectual property as it relates to both high and low tech startups and small businesses. We will also discuss the benefits and trade-offs associated with allocating hard earned investment and revenue dollars towards IP opposed to other growing business needs. During the discussion, Andrew will propose several models for structuring a company's intellectual property and lead a discussion relating the different models to different industries as well as relating each model to a business plan, funding opportunities, exit strategies, and best and worst case scenarios.</p> <p>In particular, Andrew will plan to answer the following questions:</p> <p>1) Should my company invest in intellectual property? Intellectual property has many different uses and applications. However, each use may only be applicable to specific types of companies, goals, and facts. In some cases, companies may even benefit from delaying or forgoing an investment in intellectual property, while in other cases not investing early may reduce exit opportunities or worse.</p> <p>2) How should my company begin to develop an intellectual property strategy that informs and supports the company's current situation, growth, and ultimately the company's end goals? Typically, intellectual property is a one or two line item in a company's business plan. However, in many cases, a well developed and detailed intellectual property plan may support steady growth, provide access to complimentary opportunities and/or revenue, and more accurately predict business costs.</p> <p>3) How can my company identify new funding opportunities and specific organizations that rely on intellectual property in their investment decisions? In some industries, potential purchasers, investors, and/or lending sources may become available in large part due to a well-developed intellectual property portfolio. Ensuring that your company's portfolio resonates with these individuals and entities may be an important part of a company's exit strategy.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Andrew is a partner and registered patent attorney with Lee &amp; Hayes, as well as a former general counsel for an Austin based startup. He is primarily engaged in assisting startups companies in creating legal structures, developing strategies, and obtaining IP assets that directly relate to the business development, growth, and long term goals. Andrew is a named inventor on three issued patents 8,565,458, 8,582,790, 8,611,570, as well as pending application 2013/0177188. Andrew also volunteers as a business mentor expert with a project called First Looks Forum sponsored by the Texas Entrepreneurs Network, hosts a monthly presentation series called First Success directed towards helping small businesses achieve their first business success, and organizes a monthly legal presentation series called Startup Law Austin for inventors and entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:00pm to 6:20pm: Meet &amp; Greet Networking</p> <p>6:20pm to 6:30pm: Introduction</p> <p>6:30pm to 7:30pm: Presentation</p> <p>7:30pm to 8:00pm: Q&amp;A</p> <p>8:00pm: Meeting ends and participants are requested to move to the main bar</p> <p>Organizer:</p> <p>Dr. Ataollah Etemadi</p>",Reddit /r/Austin,Intellectual Property For The Startup and Small Business,1451952000000

Games</b> offers their secondary gaming space to host <b>Werewolves of the Dark Arts.</b> This event and location has been taking place since the shop opened over two years ago.</p> <p><br/>The first game will aim to start at 7PM and the event typically runs until approximately Midnight. There will be on average 3-4 games depending on attendance. A typical month will have around 20 people taking part in heated discussions of lycanthropy and clairvoyance.</p> <p>---------</p> <p><b>F. A. Q.</b></p> <p><b>What is Werewolf/Mafia?:</b> Werewolf, also known as Mafia under its original flavor, is essentially a condensed social experiment under the guise of a game. In Werewolf, you are given a role card that only you know, and tasked to find and eliminate the players belonging to the opposite 'faction' or team. Your tools are limited only to your communication skills, observation skills, charisma, and if you're lucky, a special ability granted by your secret role.</p> <p>I've never played either game before, am I still welcome?: Definitely! A lack of experience is as much an advantage as it is a handicap. As long as you make the effort to be an active participant to the game, you'll do just fine.</p> <p><b>How does the gameplay work?:</b> Gameplay progresses in a cycle of Day Phase -&gt; Night Phase. During the Day Phase, everyone is awake and is considered to be equal. The village (those that are still alive) must reach a consensus on one person to lynch (eliminate). This is done by sitting in a circle and having discussions and making official Accusations (nominations for lynching). Once a player is eliminated, they can no longer speak or influence the game (but they can still watch). </p> <p>Following the lynching, the village goes to sleep (closes their eyes) and the ghost of the Town Mayor (GM) will call on special night-time roles one at a time in order for them to use their abilities. This includes two main abilities that you will always see: The Werewolves will decide on one person to kill, and the Seer will investigate one person to see if they are a Werewolf. </p> <p>Once all night-time abilities have been called, the village wakes up and the Town Mayor announces which players have been killed during the night. This continues until either all of the Werewolves have been killed, or until the Werewolves can take over the village by force (eg; 2 Werewolves vs two non-Werewolves).</p> <p><b>I can't make it on time. How long does a game last?:</b> A single game's length will depend on the number of people and the personality of those playing. Smaller games will typically run between 40 minutes and an hour, while larger games can last up to two hours depending on the complexity. However, I personally think watching games can be almost as much fun as playing in one, so don't worry too much about missing the start of a game.</p> <p><b>I've played Werewolf/Mafia before. What's different about Werewolves of the Dark Arts?: </b>WotDA focuses its specialty on two things. First, the social aspects that are the core of the original games. Rather than making the game about manipulating rules set in place, WotDA gives as much control to the players themselves as possible. Your actions can and will influence the fate of the village. Every player matters, every voice matters, every vote matters. This is emphasized by the way the Day Phase is executed; no timers, no Accusation limits, no leaving your seat, etc. It's all about discussion, persuasion, and diplomacy (and bloodlust). </p> <p>The other specialty of WotDA is the emphasis on mechanic balance. Every role can theoretically be included in the same game without any rules issues, <i>and</i> without the Town Mayor inadvertently giving away anything to the players through their actions during the Night Phase. Secrecy was a major concern during development, and the mechanics of the roles and intentional scripting will create an atmosphere unlike the more party-game driven Werewolf versions. </p> <p>Additionally, a lot of care was taken in keeping a strong fantasy flavor in the roles themselves. If you'd like to learn more about Werewolves of the Dark Arts, please visit <a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/""><a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://werewolfdarkarts.com/</a></a> for detailed information on all of the different roles, plus more.</p> <p><b>I heard there's social benefits to this game?:</b> Absolutely. I can personally vouch for the ability to learn a ton about interacting with other people and improving social skills such as reading others, understanding their motivations, improving your quick thinking, etc. If you make your goal of playing to gain a better understanding of others, you're definitely going to start picking up a lot about what goes on inside other people's heads.</p> <p><b>I had a ton of fun, and want to play more!

"<p>Crowdfunding hit $34B in 2015 in funds raised. There are now thousands of sites running crowdfunding campaigns and it continues to grow exponentially. Originally, crowdfunding referred to rewards and prepayments found in sites such as Kickstarter and IndieGoGo. Today, new crowdfunding portals are popping up to support every sector and type of fund raise including debt, revenue-based funding, equity, rewards/prepayment, donation, intrastate, and soon the SEC approved JOBS act. In this interactive presentation Hall Martin, Founder and CEO of the Texas Entrepreneur Networks (TEN), will review best practices for running a crowdfunding campaign including document preparation, network engagement, and time commitment. He will also cover the different types of crowdfunding models and will discuss which one is right for your deal or investment. He will show how the various crowdfunding models work - in particular, what the crowdfunding portal will do for your raise and what you will do for the raise. We’ll also discuss the costs of each.

Thus, Nerd Nite is a monthly event held in more than 50 cities across the globe during which several folks give 18-21-minute fun-yet-informative presentations across all disciplines – while the audience drinks along. And there are often bands, acrobats, trivia, and other shenanigans as well. Imagine learning about everything from math feuds or the science of the Simpsons, to the genealogy of Godzilla or debunking beer myths. Fun, right?

Games</b> offers their secondary gaming space to host <b>Werewolves of the Dark Arts.</b> This event and location has been taking place since the shop opened over two years ago.</p> <p><br/>The first game will aim to start at 7PM and the event typically runs until approximately Midnight. There will be on average 3-4 games depending on attendance. A typical month will have around 20 people taking part in heated discussions of lycanthropy and clairvoyance.</p> <p>---------</p> <p><b>F. A. Q.</b></p> <p><b>What is Werewolf/Mafia?:</b> Werewolf, also known as Mafia under its original flavor, is essentially a condensed social experiment under the guise of a game. In Werewolf, you are given a role card that only you know, and tasked to find and eliminate the players belonging to the opposite 'faction' or team. Your tools are limited only to your communication skills, observation skills, charisma, and if you're lucky, a special ability granted by your secret role.</p> <p>I've never played either game before, am I still welcome?: Definitely! A lack of experience is as much an advantage as it is a handicap. As long as you make the effort to be an active participant to the game, you'll do just fine.</p> <p><b>How does the gameplay work?:</b> Gameplay progresses in a cycle of Day Phase -&gt; Night Phase. During the Day Phase, everyone is awake and is considered to be equal. The village (those that are still alive) must reach a consensus on one person to lynch (eliminate). This is done by sitting in a circle and having discussions and making official Accusations (nominations for lynching). Once a player is eliminated, they can no longer speak or influence the game (but they can still watch). </p> <p>Following the lynching, the village goes to sleep (closes their eyes) and the ghost of the Town Mayor (GM) will call on special night-time roles one at a time in order for them to use their abilities. This includes two main abilities that you will always see: The Werewolves will decide on one person to kill, and the Seer will investigate one person to see if they are a Werewolf. </p> <p>Once all night-time abilities have been called, the village wakes up and the Town Mayor announces which players have been killed during the night. This continues until either all of the Werewolves have been killed, or until the Werewolves can take over the village by force (eg; 2 Werewolves vs two non-Werewolves).</p> <p><b>I can't make it on time. How long does a game last?:</b> A single game's length will depend on the number of people and the personality of those playing. Smaller games will typically run between 40 minutes and an hour, while larger games can last up to two hours depending on the complexity. However, I personally think watching games can be almost as much fun as playing in one, so don't worry too much about missing the start of a game.</p> <p><b>I've played Werewolf/Mafia before. What's different about Werewolves of the Dark Arts?: </b>WotDA focuses its specialty on two things. First, the social aspects that are the core of the original games. Rather than making the game about manipulating rules set in place, WotDA gives as much control to the players themselves as possible. Your actions can and will influence the fate of the village. Every player matters, every voice matters, every vote matters. This is emphasized by the way the Day Phase is executed; no timers, no Accusation limits, no leaving your seat, etc. It's all about discussion, persuasion, and diplomacy (and bloodlust). </p> <p>The other specialty of WotDA is the emphasis on mechanic balance. Every role can theoretically be included in the same game without any rules issues, <i>and</i> without the Town Mayor inadvertently giving away anything to the players through their actions during the Night Phase. Secrecy was a major concern during development, and the mechanics of the roles and intentional scripting will create an atmosphere unlike the more party-game driven Werewolf versions. </p> <p>Additionally, a lot of care was taken in keeping a strong fantasy flavor in the roles themselves. If you'd like to learn more about Werewolves of the Dark Arts, please visit <a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/""><a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://werewolfdarkarts.com/</a></a> for detailed information on all of the different roles, plus more.</p> <p><b>I heard there's social benefits to this game?:</b> Absolutely. I can personally vouch for the ability to learn a ton about interacting with other people and improving social skills such as reading others, understanding their motivations, improving your quick thinking, etc. If you make your goal of playing to gain a better understanding of others, you're definitely going to start picking up a lot about what goes on inside other people's heads.</p> <p><b>I had a ton of fun, and want to play more!

Games</b> offers their secondary gaming space to host <b>Werewolves of the Dark Arts.</b> This event and location has been taking place since the shop opened over two years ago.</p> <p><br/>The first game will aim to start at 7PM and the event typically runs until approximately Midnight. There will be on average 3-4 games depending on attendance. A typical month will have around 20 people taking part in heated discussions of lycanthropy and clairvoyance.</p> <p>---------</p> <p><b>F. A. Q.</b></p> <p><b>What is Werewolf/Mafia?:</b> Werewolf, also known as Mafia under its original flavor, is essentially a condensed social experiment under the guise of a game. In Werewolf, you are given a role card that only you know, and tasked to find and eliminate the players belonging to the opposite 'faction' or team. Your tools are limited only to your communication skills, observation skills, charisma, and if you're lucky, a special ability granted by your secret role.</p> <p><b>I've never played either game before, am I still welcome?: </b>Definitely! A lack of experience is as much an advantage as it is a handicap. As long as you make the effort to be an active participant to the game, you'll do just fine.</p> <p><b>How does the gameplay work?:</b> Gameplay progresses in a cycle of Day Phase -&gt; Night Phase. During the Day Phase, everyone is awake and is considered to be equal. The village (those that are still alive) must reach a consensus on one person to lynch (eliminate). This is done by sitting in a circle and having discussions and making official Accusations (nominations for lynching). Once a player is eliminated, they can no longer speak or influence the game (but they can still watch). </p> <p><br/>Following the lynching, the village goes to sleep (closes their eyes) and the ghost of the Town Mayor (GM) will call on special night-time roles one at a time in order for them to use their abilities. This includes two main abilities that you will always see: The <b>Werewolves </b>will decide on one person to kill, and the <b>Seer </b>will investigate one person to see if they are a Werewolf. </p> <p>Once all night-time abilities have been called, the village wakes up and the Town Mayor announces which players have been killed during the night. This continues until either all of the Werewolves have been killed, or until the Werewolves can take over the village by force (eg; 2 Werewolves vs two non-Werewolves).</p> <p><b>I've played Werewolf/Mafia before. What's different about Werewolves of the Dark Arts?:</b> WotDA focuses its specialty on two things. First, the <b>social aspects </b>that are the core of the original games. The biggest thing to note about my version is that I <i>do not use a timer</i> for the Day Phase. Rather than making the game about manipulating rules set in place, WotDA gives as much control to the players themselves as possible. Your actions can and will influence the fate of the village. Every player matters, every voice matters, every vote matters. This is emphasized by the way the Day Phase is executed; no timers, no Accusation limits, no leaving your seat, etc. It's all about discussion, persuasion, and diplomacy (and bloodlust). I have many reasons for this approach, largely involving psychology and sociology. If you're curious, ask me about it and I'll sit down for a discussion.</p> <p>The other specialty of WotDA is the emphasis on <b>mechanic balance</b>. Every role can theoretically be included in the same game without any rules issues, <i>and</i> without the Town Mayor inadvertently giving away anything to the players through their actions during the Night Phase. Secrecy was a major concern during development, and the mechanics of the roles and intentional scripting will create an atmosphere unlike the more party-game driven Werewolf versions. The end result is an experience fueled by only the discussion of the Day Phase, and the information gained by individual players from their Night Phase abilities. </p> <p>Additionally, a lot of care was taken in keeping a strong fantasy flavor in the roles themselves. If you'd like to learn more about <b>Werewolves of the Dark Arts</b>, please visit <a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/""><a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://werewolfdarkarts.com/</a></a> for detailed information on all of the different roles, plus strategies, history, and more.</p> <p><b>I can't make it on time. How long does a game last?:</b> A single game's length will depend on the number of people and the personality of those playing. Smaller games will typically run between 40 minutes and an hour, while larger games can last up to two hours depending on the complexity. However, I personally feel watching games can be almost as much fun as playing in one, so don't worry too much about missing the start of a game or joining in the first game if you'd rather watch.</p> <p><b>I heard there's social benefits to this game?:</b> Absolutely. I can personally vouch for the ability to learn a ton about interacting with other people and improving social skills such as reading others, understanding their motivations, improving your quick thinking, etc. If you make your goal of playing to gain a better understanding of others, you're definitely going to start picking up a lot about what goes on inside other people's heads.</p> <p><b>I had a ton of fun, and want to play more!

Games</b> offers their secondary gaming space to host <b>Werewolves of the Dark Arts.</b> This event and location has been taking place since the shop opened over two years ago.</p> <p><br/>The first game will aim to start at 7PM and the event typically runs until approximately Midnight. There will be on average 3-4 games depending on attendance. A typical month will have around 20 people taking part in heated discussions of lycanthropy and clairvoyance.</p> <p>---------</p> <p><b>F. A. Q.</b></p> <p><b>What is Werewolf/Mafia?:</b> Werewolf, also known as Mafia under its original flavor, is essentially a condensed social experiment under the guise of a game. In Werewolf, you are given a role card that only you know, and tasked to find and eliminate the players belonging to the opposite 'faction' or team. Your tools are limited only to your communication skills, observation skills, charisma, and if you're lucky, a special ability granted by your secret role.</p> <p><b>I've never played either game before, am I still welcome?: </b>Definitely! A lack of experience is as much an advantage as it is a handicap. As long as you make the effort to be an active participant to the game, you'll do just fine.</p> <p><b>How does the gameplay work?:</b> Gameplay progresses in a cycle of Day Phase -&gt; Night Phase. During the Day Phase, everyone is awake and is considered to be equal. The village (those that are still alive) must reach a consensus on one person to lynch (eliminate). This is done by sitting in a circle and having discussions and making official Accusations (nominations for lynching). Once a player is eliminated, they can no longer speak or influence the game (but they can still watch). </p> <p><br/>Following the lynching, the village goes to sleep (closes their eyes) and the ghost of the Town Mayor (GM) will call on special night-time roles one at a time in order for them to use their abilities. This includes two main abilities that you will always see: The <b>Werewolves </b>will decide on one person to kill, and the <b>Seer </b>will investigate one person to see if they are a Werewolf. </p> <p>Once all night-time abilities have been called, the village wakes up and the Town Mayor announces which players have been killed during the night. This continues until either all of the Werewolves have been killed, or until the Werewolves can take over the village by force (eg; 2 Werewolves vs two non-Werewolves).</p> <p><b>I've played Werewolf/Mafia before. What's different about Werewolves of the Dark Arts?:</b> WotDA focuses its specialty on two things. First, the <b>social aspects </b>that are the core of the original games. The biggest thing to note about my version is that I <i>do not use a timer</i> for the Day Phase. Rather than making the game about manipulating rules set in place, WotDA gives as much control to the players themselves as possible. Your actions can and will influence the fate of the village. Every player matters, every voice matters, every vote matters. This is emphasized by the way the Day Phase is executed; no timers, no Accusation limits, no leaving your seat, etc. It's all about discussion, persuasion, and diplomacy (and bloodlust). I have many reasons for this approach, largely involving psychology and sociology. If you're curious, ask me about it and I'll sit down for a discussion.</p> <p>The other specialty of WotDA is the emphasis on <b>mechanic balance</b>. Every role can theoretically be included in the same game without any rules issues, <i>and</i> without the Town Mayor inadvertently giving away anything to the players through their actions during the Night Phase. Secrecy was a major concern during development, and the mechanics of the roles and intentional scripting will create an atmosphere unlike the more party-game driven Werewolf versions. The end result is an experience fueled by only the discussion of the Day Phase, and the information gained by individual players from their Night Phase abilities. </p> <p>Additionally, a lot of care was taken in keeping a strong fantasy flavor in the roles themselves. If you'd like to learn more about <b>Werewolves of the Dark Arts</b>, please visit <a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/""><a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://werewolfdarkarts.com/</a></a> for detailed information on all of the different roles, plus strategies, history, and more.</p> <p><b>I can't make it on time. How long does a game last?:</b> A single game's length will depend on the number of people and the personality of those playing. Smaller games will typically run between 40 minutes and an hour, while larger games can last up to two hours depending on the complexity. However, I personally feel watching games can be almost as much fun as playing in one, so don't worry too much about missing the start of a game or joining in the first game if you'd rather watch.</p> <p><b>I heard there's social benefits to this game?:</b> Absolutely. I can personally vouch for the ability to learn a ton about interacting with other people and improving social skills such as reading others, understanding their motivations, improving your quick thinking, etc. If you make your goal of playing to gain a better understanding of others, you're definitely going to start picking up a lot about what goes on inside other people's heads.</p> <p><b>I had a ton of fun, and want to play more!

Once a player is eliminated, they can no longer speak or influence the game (but they can still watch). </p> <p><br/>Following the lynching, the village goes to sleep (closes their eyes) and the ghost of the Town Mayor (GM) will call on special night-time roles one at a time in order for them to use their abilities. This includes two main abilities that you will always see: The <b>Werewolves </b>will decide on one person to kill, and the <b>Seer </b>will investigate one person to see if they are a Werewolf. </p> <p>Once all night-time abilities have been called, the village wakes up and the Town Mayor announces which players have been killed during the night. This continues until either all of the Werewolves have been killed, or until the Werewolves can take over the village by force (eg; 2 Werewolves vs two non-Werewolves).</p> <p><b>I've played Werewolf/Mafia before. What's different about Werewolves of the Dark Arts?:</b> WotDA focuses its specialty on two things. First, the <b>social aspects </b>that are the core of the original games. The biggest thing to note about my version is that I <i>do not use a timer</i> for the Day Phase. Rather than making the game about manipulating rules set in place, WotDA gives as much control to the players themselves as possible. Your actions can and will influence the fate of the village. Every player matters, every voice matters, every vote matters. This is emphasized by the way the Day Phase is executed; no timers, no Accusation limits, no leaving your seat, etc. It's all about discussion, persuasion, and diplomacy (and bloodlust). I have many reasons for this approach, largely involving psychology and sociology. If you're curious, ask me about it and I'll sit down for a discussion.</p> <p>The other specialty of WotDA is the emphasis on <b>mechanic balance</b>. Every role can theoretically be included in the same game without any rules issues, <i>and</i> without the Town Mayor inadvertently giving away anything to the players through their actions during the Night Phase. Secrecy was a major concern during development, and the mechanics of the roles and intentional scripting will create an atmosphere unlike the more party-game driven Werewolf versions. The end result is an experience fueled by only the discussion of the Day Phase, and the information gained by individual players from their Night Phase abilities. </p> <p>Additionally, a lot of care was taken in keeping a strong fantasy flavor in the roles themselves. If you'd like to learn more about <b>Werewolves of the Dark Arts</b>, please visit <a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/""><a href=""http://werewolfdarkarts.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://werewolfdarkarts.com/</a></a> for detailed information on all of the different roles, plus strategies, history, and more.</p> <p><b>I can't make it on time. How long does a game last?:</b> A single game's length will depend on the number of people and the personality of those playing. Smaller games will typically run between 40 minutes and an hour, while larger games can last up to two hours depending on the complexity. However, I personally feel watching games can be almost as much fun as playing in one, so don't worry too much about missing the start of a game or joining in the first game if you'd rather watch.</p> <p><b>I heard there's social benefits to this game?:</b> Absolutely. I can personally vouch for the ability to learn a ton about interacting with other people and improving social skills such as reading others, understanding their motivations, improving your quick thinking, etc. If you make your goal of playing to gain a better understanding of others, you're definitely going to start picking up a lot about what goes on inside other people's heads.</p> <p><b>I had a ton of fun, and want to play more!

"<p>For the last several months the <i>""Press-o-Shere"" </i>has been filled with news about the critical importance of the WordPress JSON REST API to the future of the platform. </p> <p>During this past year, the JSON REST API has been a frequent topic of discussion at the Advanced WordPress Dev meet-ups. Nick Batik thought to use our first Deep Dive Discussion of 2016 to focus the conversation on getting our WPATX practitioners and endusers familiar with the concepts of the JASON REST APIs. </p> <p>This will be an informal discussion of concepts you need to understand in order to take  advantage of the possibilities full adoption of the REST API will open up to our community of users. <b>This conversation will not be a technical ""HOW-TO.""</b> Our purpose is to introduce the REST API to those who unfamiliar with the topic, and help them prepare for a more technical understanding of the subject.</p> <p><b>The WPATX Organizers are planning a Technical Panel Discussion of the WORDPRESS JASON REST API for our WordPress Practitioners Meetup March 22. </b>Our Build a Sign venue can hold up to 80 attendees and we expect that it will be a full house.

"<p>Sandi Batik will lead this month's Deep Dive Discussion which will focus on what it takes to build a successful freelance WordPress business. The WPATX organizers have had numerous requests to devote more meetups to the ""Business"" of WordPress.  <i>If this discussion topic proves popular, we will expand the topic into a more formal class for our WordPress Practitioners meetup, which is hosted in a larger venue.</i></p> <p><br/>Please come prepared to talk about the tools and techniques you currently use in the everyday course of your business. Topics will include prospecting, marketing, proposal writing, client interviews and on boarding, project management, client management, project close-out and invoicing client follow-up and what ever else you might want to address in the time we have.</p> <p>HubAustin can comfortably manage about 25 folks. We have had a on-going problem with members who are committing to go, changing their minds, but not their RSVP on this page. This has resulted in folks on the waiting list missing a discussion they really wanted to attend. This year, we will take attendance for every meeting that has a wait list. </p> <p>If two times in a 12 month period, someone who has committed to attend, but is a No-SHOW who has not changed their RSVP to open their spot; that person will be considered a probable no-show and their spot automatically opened for the next person in line. </p> <p>Tracking this means extra work for the WPATX organizers, which I personally am not happy about, but we have had so many complaints from other members who are missing a class unnecessarily, that we have to do something. I am open to any non-lethal options - I  did mention that we are getting a lot of member complaints right. ;-) </p> <p>Please be considerate and lets make our small-group discussions fun, not a bone to be fought over.  Thanks so much for your undersatnading and cooperation - Sandi</p>",The Austin WordPress Meetup Group,The WordPress Freelancer's Tool Box,1454979600000

Photoblogs and Galleries will also be discussed, as well as some of the best plugins to use to manage and/or display images. We will close with a Q&amp;A.

"<p>This month's WordPress Practitioner's Meetup is the first in a series of ""The Business of WordPress"" topics our member's have requested. Our WP Practitioners attendees are about evenly divided between business owners and mangers who use WordPress daily in their businesses, and WordPress Freelancers, Developers and Implementors who are building and maintaining WordPress sites for businesses. When I read your topic requests, I approached small business specialist, Sarah Flaherty about presenting to our group. </p> <p>Sarah's tag line is, “Let me think outside the box for you,” illustrates her love for helping emerging businesses and her creativity. In today’s world, there is no unique business, there is only uniqueness. Finding your unique voice is the first and foremost need of a successful business or Freelancer. </p> <p>Your firm’s voice is the single­most important business fundamental, and it is often ignored in our WordPress Community of Developers and Designers. Consumers no longer shop locally, they shop globally ­ on their terms. This makes competition to get their attention, and keep it, fierce. You must be in constant communication with your clients in order to maintain sales and growth. However, you can’t achieve this through a great logo and a fabulous website. You must engage directly with your clients, and this requires you to have a curated voice; consumers flock to you and become your loyal evangelists when they hear and experience your care of them consistently ­ when they know your firm's personality, what and why it's passionate about, and what they can always count on. </p> <p><br/>Sarah C. Flaherty of LUV, LLC will briefly discuss the need to find your voice, how to shape it, and what to do with it once you’ve found it ­ with a focus on social media. This presentation will be followed by a group project that allows you to take a company from conception to initial client communication and will show you the importance of aligning your company’s mission statement with your visuals and content. This will help you better understand your need to content curate to find your firm's unique voice and how to use it going forward.</p> <p>With Sarah’s help, you’ll find that not only will you better understand the hows and whys of what you want to do, but you’ll be better able to focus potential clients’ attention on your business, and keep it.</p> <p><br/>We look forward to seeing you there. Bring your questions and your laptop. The seating at Build-a-Sign can difficult if you are very tall or have a tricky back, so when in doubt, bring a camp chair for your comfort. </p>",The Austin WordPress Meetup Group,Finding Your Company’s Voice,1458691200000

Our presenters will address  new ways to interact with WordPress posts, users, comments, and taxonomies using the RESTful API standard, which will allow you to create, read, update, and delete the main WordPress objects and provides infrastructure for creating your own custom APIs. They will also discuss how the WordPress REST API can give us the opportunity to integrate with technologies currently outside the WordPress ecosystem.</p> <p>As part of our WP Austin REST Day, we are putting together a WordPress REST API Resources Guide for our WPATX Developers and Practitioners. </p> <p>The morning session will open with several 20-minute presentations. </p> <p><b>Ryan Hoover will lead of the morning sessions off with:</b></p> <p><b>Getting started with the REST API</b></p> <p>• Get it installed on your site</p> <p>• Access posts, comments, other information</p> <p>• Incorporate it into your own site</p> <p><b>Making your own REST API endpoint</b></p> <p>• Give a walk through of the endpoint code structure</p> <p>• Write an endpoint for getting a menu from the WP site</p> <p>• Demonstration of a feature Ryan Hoover wrote for WP Engine to fetch menu items from a WordPress site</p> <p><b>Non-JSON uses of the REST API</b></p> <p>•  A demonstration of a REST API feature WP Engine uses to serve up post thumbnail images based on dynamic URLs</p> <p><b>Ryan Oeltjenbruns will follow with:</b></p> <p><b> The traditional view of a web request (front end &amp; back end)</b></p> <p>• Quick understanding of the traditional web request workflow</p> <p>• What does the back end do?</p> <p>• What does the front end do?</p> <p><b>The API approach</b></p> <p>• Quick understanding of a more API focused web request workflow</p> <p>• More generic html source + templates -- shifting some of the work to the front-end</p> <p>• More Javascript heavy front ends that know how to interact with the API</p> <p><b>How this shift directs the focus to the front end, and what this means for WordPress</b></p> <p>• WordPress as a data store? An api?

I see the WP REST API as a WordPress feature that makes it easier to interact with your site’s data.”</i></p> <p><br/>I hope we will see you at the 2016 WP Austin REST DAY!</p>",The Austin WordPress Meetup Group,Announcing the WP Austin REST Day!,1466170200000

"<p>This is an interactive session for contributing to the opensource work on WordPress. Everyone would bring their laptops and work in flexible groups with any assistance they wanted from me. </p> <p>


Contributing to opensource work is a great way to learn how to work on a tech team before getting the job.

Practitioners shouldn't think that contributing is just for coders because a big part of the process is verifying tickets by recreating bugs. Their insight would be valuable here. </p> <p>

"<p>Join Lee &amp; Hayes for a breakfast program on <i><b>IP and Startups</b></i>.</p> <p>Intellectual property is a company’s most valuable asset, but how should organizations go about protecting it? This interactive core conversation will discuss the pros and cons of planning, obtaining, and maintaining intellectual property as it relates to both high tech and low tech startups. While investing in intellectual property is critical to an organization’s success, the process can be costly and resource-intensive. During this conversation, Andrew will address the benefits and tradeoffs associated with allocating hard earned investment dollars towards intellectual property as opposed to other growing business needs. Andrew also will propose several models for structuring a startup's intellectual property and lead a discussion relating the different models as they apply to different industries. The discussion will also relate each model to a startup's business plan, funding opportunities, exit strategies, and best and worst case scenarios. 1. How should my new venture begin to develop an intellectual property strategy that informs and supports the company’s current situation, growth, and ultimately the company's end goals?</p> <p>2. What piece should intellectual property play with respect to marketing and branding my venture?</p> <p>3. How should my venture weigh the costs and benefits associated with obtaining intellectual property?</p> <p><b>Program Schedule</b></p> <p>8:00 a.m. - 8:30 am<br/>Registration check-in &amp; continental breakfast </p> <p>8:30 a.m. – 9:30 a.m.<br/>Presentation</p> <p>9:30 a.m. – 10 a.m.<br/>Q&amp;A / Wrap-up</p> <p><b>Speaker - Andrew Eisenberg</b></p> <p><img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/3/3/2/600_447178162.jpeg"" /></p> <p>Andrew is a partner and registered patent attorney with Lee &amp; Hayes, one of the country’s leading patent firms.

"<p>In this interactive presentation, Andrew will discuss the pros and cons of planning, obtaining, and maintaining intellectual property as it relates to both high and low tech startups and small businesses. We will also discuss the benefits and trade-offs associated with allocating hard earned investment and revenue dollars towards IP opposed to other growing business needs. During the discussion, Andrew will propose several models for structuring a company's intellectual property and lead a discussion relating the different models to different industries as well as relating each model to a business plan, funding opportunities, exit strategies, and best and worst case scenarios.</p> <p>In particular, Andrew will plan to answer the following questions:</p> <p>1) Should my company invest in intellectual property? Intellectual property has many different uses and applications. However, each use may only be applicable to specific types of companies, goals, and facts. In some cases, companies may even benefit from delaying or forgoing an investment in intellectual property, while in other cases not investing early may reduce exit opportunities or worse.</p> <p>2) How should my company begin to develop an intellectual property strategy that informs and supports the company's current situation, growth, and ultimately the company's end goals? Typically, intellectual property is a one or two line item in a company's business plan. However, in many cases, a well developed and detailed intellectual property plan may support steady growth, provide access to complimentary opportunities and/or revenue, and more accurately predict business costs.</p> <p>3) How can my company identify new funding opportunities and specific organizations that rely on intellectual property in their investment decisions? In some industries, potential purchasers, investors, and/or lending sources may become available in large part due to a well-developed intellectual property portfolio. Ensuring that your company's portfolio resonates with these individuals and entities may be an important part of a company's exit strategy.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Andrew is a partner and registered patent attorney with Lee &amp; Hayes, as well as a former general counsel for an Austin based startup.  He is primarily engaged in assisting startups companies in creating legal structures, developing strategies, and obtaining IP assets that directly relate to the business development, growth, and long term goals.

"<p>Crowdfunding hit $34B in 2015 in funds raised. There are now thousands of sites running crowdfunding campaigns and it continues to grow exponentially.  Originally, crowdfunding referred to rewards and prepayments found in sites such as Kickstarter and IndieGoGo.  Today, new crowdfunding portals are popping up to support every sector and type of fund raise including debt, revenue-based funding, equity, rewards/prepayment, donation, intrastate, and soon the SEC approved JOBS act.  </p> <p>In this interactive presentation <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hallmartin"">Hall Martin</a>, Founder and CEO of the Texas Entrepreneur Networks (TEN), will review best practices for running a crowdfunding campaign including document preparation, network engagement, and time commitment.  He will also cover the different types of crowdfunding models and will discuss which one is right for your deal or investment.  </p> <p>He will show how the various crowdfunding models work - in particular, what the crowdfunding portal will do for your raise and what you will do for the raise.  We’ll also discuss the costs of each.

For students starting a 4 year technology-based college degree, this means that half of what they learn in in their first year of study will be outdated by their third year of study. The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that today’s learner will have 10-14 different jobs by the age of 38.</p> <p>We are currently preparing students for jobs that don’t yet exist, using technologies that haven’t been invented, in order to solve problems we don’t yet know are problems.</p> <p>Google, Hello World, and General Assembly invite you to join this event and explore the innovative ways in which Austin is rising to the challenge.

About This Class</p> <p>Ground zero intro to managing your own hosting. Why pay for ""managed hosting"" if you can learn to be a Linux system administrator? This is where the ""backend"" in full-stack development starts. Whether you want to learn a little Linux to further your career, or you want more control of your blog, website or app's destiny, you'll go step by step through the most basic Linux commands, one line at a time, and leave with a web server that belongs to you.</p> <p>As a blogger, PJ Brunet had to learn Linux, after years of paying other people to do it for him, because he found web hosts for hire weren't invested enough in keeping him online 24/7. Once mastered, PJ was able and determined to help other businesses that were not adequately served.</p> <p>During this course you will install NginX and configure ssh. By the end of this class, you will have ""Hello World"" live on the web with an IP address and the knowledge of why it's important.</p>",General Assembly Austin,Be Your Own Web Host with Linux,1462231800000

After all, how often do you re-read the notes you take? And when you do, how vividly do they bring the original event back into your mind? Chances are, those handwritten or typed notes aren’t making much traction after the fact. But there is a better way.</p> <p>Visual note-taking, or Sketchnoting, is a method of listening and recording information using both words and pictures. It helps with information retention, improves your brain’s ability to stay engaged during the event, and it’s fun. Best of all, anyone can do it. This hands-on workshop will prove it to you, introducing you to the fundamentals of sketchnoting and providing practice in both listening and drawing. Participants will leave armed with the knowledge and tools to think, capture, and communicate in big picture ways.</p> <p>Takeaways</p> <p>An understanding of the benefits of visual note-taking (or Sketchnoting) for both listening and communicating<br/>An introduction to the Sketchnoting process and the basic anatomy of a Sketchnote<br/>Hands-on experience building your own visual vocabulary<br/>Tools and techniques to strengthen your visual practice<br/>Personal confidence in your ability to listen and draw your (and others’) ideas</p> <p>Prereqs &amp; Preparation</p> <p>Students must bring a pen and an unlined notebook.</p>",General Assembly Austin,Intro to Sketchnoting: Fundamentals of Visual Notetaking,1476747000000

"<p><b>--Addendum--</b></p> <p><b>This is a reschedule of the event originally scheduled for 1/16/16. Due to a scheduling conflict, this event is now rescheduled for 1/23/16. The notification went out too late on 1/16, and many people showed up anyway. We were able to whip up an ad-hoc session on 1/16, but we'll be starting over again on 1/23. So if you weren't there for the originally scheduled event on 1/16, you didn't miss anything! </b></p> <p><b>I apologize for any inconvenience. </b></p> <p>Now, back to our regularly scheduled program, already in progress...</p> <p>Well, this is it. We decided to start putting together IoT Workshops. This maybe crazy... more like crazy fun!!</p> <p>On Saturday January 16th, we will be getting started with the Raspberry Pi. This meet up will be slightly more catered to people who know command line, SSH, and a few other basic tools. However, for those that are completely new to these tools; I have put together a guide on how to get your setup ready for the meetup to play with the technologies which we will be covering. (Will be providing a link soon!). In this Meetup, we will be covering a few libraries out there to interface with the Raspberry Pi GPIO, setting up a server on the Raspberry Pi, and some really cool data analytics tools in Python.</p> <p>For this meetup you will need the following which will not be supplied by the event organizers:</p> <p>1x Raspberry Pi (Doesn't matter which version)</p> <p>1x SD Card reader (Assuming you aren't using the Raspberry Pi Compute)</p> <p>1x USB Wifi Module that supports AP Mode</p> <p>


In the Future we will be playing more with little electronic bits so also be on the look out for the following:</p> <p>


1x Set of Dupont Wires</p> <p>1x Solder-less Breadboard </p> <p>1x Collection of RGB LEDs</p> <p>2x PIR Motion Detectors</p> <p>3x Soil Moisture Sensors</p> <p>And more to come.</p> <p>

"<p>Due to popular demand, we will be hosting brief 2 hour workshops learn programming basics. Like the workshops, we will be having these once a month with basic outlines. These however will be slightly less structured and will follow a few books (TBD) The first dozen or so will be based in Python. Requirements will be a laptop and maybe the Raspberry Pi? Depends on what people want. Please let me know via slack!</p> <p>


UPDATE #1: After having looked over several books that I have read and a few that I haven't. I will be using the book ""Learning Python, 5th Edition"" by Mark Lutz from O'Reilly Media. (ISBN: [masked]) as a GENERAL GUIDE. This will book will serve as a supplemental text like any other class you take. Although the topics we will cover will align to some degree from this book, we will not follow it verbatim. This text is only to serve as a guide for those that want to really dive into Python Programming and want to have another resource/reference. I strongly recommend those that have zero experience with Python and/or programming in general to take a look at the book. It is available where ever books are sold (Amazon, Google Play, Barnes and Noble, etc)</p> <p>


UPDATE #2: Prior to attending this workshop, you will need to install Anaconda Python. For those that are following along with the Raspberry Pi Workshops will already be somewhat familiar with Anaconda and may have it installed locally on their machines. If you do not; please follow the instructions here (<a href=""https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install"" class=""linkified"">https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install</a>) for your system. We will be using iPython/Jupyter notebooks for most of if not all of the examples and demos. Failure to have this installed  prior to coming will more than likely result in a bad experience as we won't be covering this in the workshop and you may fall behind. Although you can install it once you are there, it's a relatively large download and internet speeds at TechShop vary depending on how many people are there. </p>",Austin Internet Of Things,IoT Road To Code,1458406800000

Intel will be providing complimentary appetizers, free domestic beers, and free rail mixed drinks for this event.*</p> <p><br/>Then, at 7:15, we will hear from some of the winners and participants from the IoT Roadshow hackathon. Many of those winners came from our own Austin IoT Meetup Group! </p> <p>James Roberts will be presenting on an array of sensors which toggle on and off various appliances in your home by shining a laser pointer at one of the sensors from afar.  The laser-pointers can multiplex with other inputs from the cloud. This project uses two Intel Edisons speaking to one another wirelessly:  one to run the sensors, and the other to control the appliances.</p> <p>Senh Chuang will be prenesting Honey-Dos-I(o)T, An IoT to do IT when you are not there. Currently, the project senses user presence, and turns on and off home AC/Heater to power saving mode when the user is not there. The project fetures API to access data. This project is mainly for couples where one or a both people do not know how to use their Internet enabled devices. From watering the plants, to checking &amp; reporting the weather. It even displays the current lottery numbers! It will do all of this while the user is away. When the user is home, the information will be ready for the user to view</p> <p>David Fowler and Carlos Santiago will be presenting on their team's Home Sentry robot. Start with a IoT sensor platform that monitors any room in your home for things like temperature, humidity, sound, and motion detection. That’s great but you want one for every room. Place the sensor platform on a robot chassis and it’s carried to every room in the home, makes short visits to collect data then move on.

"<p>It's getting hot in here, watch how temperature grows! &lt;/rap&gt;</p> <p>This month's workshop will begin with an overview of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) and I2C (I^2C). PWM is the communication technology used by the DHT22 digital temperature and humidity sensor.  I2C is the communication protocol used by accelerometers to communicate over an I2C bus.</p> <p>Then we will switch to hands-on mode, and connect temperature sensors and accelerometers to our Pi's, and see the results. </p> <p>If there's any time leftover, we might start talking about the Particle Photon.</p> <p>If you haven't received your sensors and/or accelerometers yet, please come anyway, as there may be extras there that we can share. If you don't have your Raspberry Pi (2 or 3) yet, still come anyway, so you can learn and ask questions. There's no such thing as a stupid question!

"<p>We will start with our normal open networking and Meet &amp; Greet from 7:00p-7:15p at Sherlock's. </p> <p><br/>Then at 7:15, Ed Hightower with Ingenu will present a brief history of IoT/M2M and the LPWAN landscape with a focus on the Ingenu Machine Network. Austin is one of the first of 100 cities in the US and over 50 countries worldwide that will soon get a public version of this low power, wide area network (LPWAN). It is a low-cost cellular-like network dedicated to machine-only communications.</p> <p>Ed’s talk will feature case studies in RPMA, including projects he’s been involved with for Elmar, WellAware, and LED Roadway Lighting. Random phase multiple access (RPMA) is a low-power wide-area channel access method used exclusively for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication on the Internet of Things.</p> <p>The Machine Network will be much like a cellular network but will not have any Smartphone or voice traffic on it. It will be optimized for communications to/from devices/objects/equipment only, will operate on a battery that will last at least 10+ years, and will be a low cost network.</p> <p>The Machine Network is an enabling technology, but it will need device/sensor makers and applications/solutions providers to create end-to-end solutions, and systems integrators to marry all this together to solve customer problems.</p> <p>Join us as we explore these ideas and look for ways to work together.  What we build here and now can be deployed as the Machine Network is turned on in each new city and country around the world. Be a part of this exciting journey!</p> <p>And, most importantly, Ingenu is buying the first drink! Be sure to see your Organizer, Dave Brixius, when you arrive to get your free drink ticket.</p> <p>Also this night, Graeme Cloughley and Michael Hathaway are going to talk about their company, Information Xchange (IX), which operates a subscription based network service supporting Industrial Internet and Industrial IoT (IIOT) applications ranging from electric &amp; water sub-metering to connected (smart) buildings. </p> <p>The IX platform is a light weight, disruptive Industrial Internet Platform capable of being customized to support a variety of market verticals including but not limited to, HealthCare, Transportation, Connected Buildings and Smart Cities. </p> <p><i>Austin IoT is a sharing group.

It can then evaluate them against rules defined by the user and generate new messages based on those definitions. Users can create campaigns to handle whatever business requirement they have. The platform has taken a very non-coding approach, where the only coding that is needed is a few lines of code to integrate their SDK. Then the rest is managed via a web console where changes happen in real time. </p> <p>Jarie will discuss the history behind the platform, some of the use cases they've found, explore the web console UI, and how Cogswell differentiates from other IoT platforms currently available to users.</p> <p>Austin IoT is a sharing group.

"<p><a href=""https://vuejs.org/"">Vue.js</a> is a library for building interactive web interfaces. The goal of Vue.js is to provide the benefits of reactive data binding and composable view components with an API that is as simple as possible.</p> <p>Vue.js itself is not a full-blown framework -- it is focused on the view layer only. It is therefore very easy to pick up and to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.""</p> <p><br/>Our goal for this group is that by the end of the class you will be able to code your own awesome ideas and apps! You will also have a good foundation for practicing programming.</p> <p><b>Exercise Schedule </b><br/>Exercises 1-10</p> <p>If you are still getting started, please feel free to join us!

The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.""</p> <p><br/>Our goal for this group is that by the end of the class you will be able to code your own awesome ideas and apps! You will also have a good foundation for practicing programming.</p> <p><b>Exercise Schedule </b></p> <p><br/>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex11.html"">Exercise 11: Asking Questions</a> </p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex12.html"">Exercise 12: Prompting People</a> </p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex13.html"">Exercise 13: Parameters, Unpacking, Variables</a> </p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex14.html"">Exercise 14: Prompting And Passing</a> </p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex15.html"">Exercise 15: Reading Files</a> </p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex16.html"">Exercise 16: Reading And Writing Files</a> </p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex17.html"">Exercise 17: More Files</a></p> <p>If you are still getting started, please feel free to join us!

Then there will be instruction time covering that week's exercises. To wrap up we will work on some fun code katas to practice what we learned. What is a code kata? Glad you asked! </p> <p>""A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition. The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.""</p> <p><br/>Our goal for this group is that by the end of the class you will be able to code your own awesome ideas and apps! You will also have a good foundation for practicing programming.</p> <p><b>Exercise Schedule </b></p> <p><br/><a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex18.html"">• Exercise 18: Names, Variables, Code, Functions</a></p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex19.html"">Exercise 19: Functions And Variables</a></p> <p><a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex20.html"">• Exercise 20: Functions And Files</a></p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex21.html"">Exercise 21: Functions Can Return Something</a></p> <p><a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex22.html"">• Exercise 22: What Do You Know So Far?</a></p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex23.html"">Exercise 23: Read Some Code</a></p> <p><a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex24.html"">• Exercise 24: More Practice</a></p> <p>• <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex25.html"">Exercise 25: Even More Practice</a></p> <p><a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex26.html"">• Exercise 26: Congratulations, Take A Test!</a></p> <p>If you are still getting started, please feel free to join us!

TopCoder is also a helpful site, but we won't use it for group practise. If you are interviewing soon this is a time to coach each other!</p> <p>This week we will be practising algorithms.  Suggestion is to (i) pseudo code for others in the group who don't use your programming language &amp; to check calculations and (ii) write the code in your programming language.</p> <p>We have a slack channel devoted to algorithms so please post any you've had or find challenging.</p> <p>A final suggestion is to have a programming environment up for your language of choice -- either at the command line or in a GUI like Jupyter notebook.  This is useful to test your algorithms -- the answer for a certain data input in general should be the same across programming languages.</p>",Women Who Code Austin,Tech Interview Practise,1461524400000

Every second of every day, people search on Indeed to find a job that fits their mission, their need to contribute and their desire to make something work better. </p> <p>Come help Indeed work. They are looking to grow their teams with people who share their energy and enthusiasm for creating the best experience for job seekers.

Powerful computing infrastructure is required to calculate statistics such as the most frequently occurring elements. But many times you only need approximate answers, rather than accurate ones. Probabilistic data structures are a common way to get those approximate answers with orders of magnitude savings in resources. In this talk we’ll discuss three of these data structures: Bloom filters, Hyperloglog and Count-min sketches. We will demystify the math behind these data structures with intuitive examples that explain how they work. We will also discuss concrete use cases for each of these in real world applications, and learn about available open source implementations in common programming languages.</p> <p><b>Participants </b><br/>This event is intended for all women (trans and cis), trans men, and genderqueer folks who are interested in attending, as well as their guests.</p> <p><b>Food<br/></b> Food and drinks sponsored by Indeed!</p> <p><b>Parking</b></p> <p><b>Location<br/></b>6433 Champion Grandview Way, Bldg I<br/>Austin, TX 78759</p> <p><br/><b>Contact</b><br/>Lili Serfaty at[masked]-7689.</p> <p><b>Code of Conduct</b><br/>No harassment: Women Who Code is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion.

"<p>Hey Coders,</p> <p>This month's tech talk is brought to you by <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/design/"">IBM Design</a>! </p> <p>IBM is on a mission to create a sustainable culture of design and to bring a human-centered focus to thousands of product and service experiences. IBM Design is the new design organization based in Austin, Texas, where designers, engineers, and business leaders collaborate to help create a new way of working that will impact humanity in ways that matter and endure. When complete, this transformation will make IBM the largest product design organization in the world.</p> <p><b>Speaker</b></p> <p><br/>Kelly Churchill</p> <p>Despite being from New Orleans, most consider Kelly a native Austinite; having lived in Austin for 12 years, she has lived here 6 times longer than most. Being raised in New Orleans has given Kelly traits that she shares with a lively city that's steeped in tradition. Growing up in the South in the time that she did, girls were not typically encouraged to pursue technical careers, so instead she began working as a secretary. However, the call of coding was powerful and Kelly finally answered by pursuing a degree in Computer Science while simultaneously starting a family. One of her proudest moments was earning her degree knowing that her daughters, ages six and four, were in the audience watching her walk across stage to receive her diploma. Since that time, Kelly has built her career as a web developer by freelancing and working for interactive agencies, and she is now a software engineer at IBM, where she focuses on front end development and serves as an accessibility expert on her product team.</p> <p><b>Talk</b></p> <p><br/>Accessibility is a word that when spoken causes varied reactions from developers. Many developers realize the importance of creating accessible user interfaces, but given the reality that most websites on the Internet today are not accessible for persons with disabilities, many either fail to try because of the perceived difficulty, or fail because they think that simply adding &lt;alt&gt; tags to the images on their website makes it accessible. While there is more to building accessible websites than using &lt;alt&gt; tags, achieving accessibility becomes much easier when it is addressed at the design phase rather than until just before launch when someone thinks to ask, “is it accessible?” We will talk about some easy ways to incorporate accessibility into your projects from the beginning to avoid the difficult challenges of integrating accessibility into the functionality of an existing website, especially when those sites are being updated in a continuous delivery environment.</p> <p><b>Participants </b><br/>This event is intended for all women (trans and cis), trans men, and genderqueer folks who are interested in attending, as well as their guests.</p> <p><b>Food<br/></b> Food and drinks sponsored by IBM</p> <p><b>Parking</b></p> <p><b>Location<br/></b></p> <p>11501 Burnet Rd, Austin, TX 78758<br/>Building 903<br/>7th Floor</p> <p><b>Contact</b><br/>Lili Serfaty at (512) 677-7689.</p> <p><b>Code of Conduct</b><br/>No harassment: Women Who Code is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion.

"<p>We will be doing programming exercises, so please bring a laptop with your preferred programming language and environment (IDE or code / text editor) installed. The church has WiFi.</p> <p>



It may be good for us to have a Github repository into which each member could contribute solutions of the exercises. That way we could discuss various people' solutions. This would be on a strictly volunteer basis: if you don't want your solutions to be discussed, you don't have to submit them.</p> <p>


Due to the setup at the church, only the church computer can be connected to the projector; it is not possible for guests to do that. So the only way to let the group see somebody's solution would be for me to bring it up on Github and display it via the projector.</p> <p>


If you are interested in signing up for a group code repository, please let me know your Github user ID. You can post it here or message it to me privately. If there is enough interest, I'll create a repository.</p> <p>

Based on community request, we have asked her to spend an extra day with us and host a 4 hour workshop covering the latest techniques on scraping the web with Python. There will only be one section of this class. Don't wait to buy your ticket!</p> <p><b>Crawling the Web with Python</b></p> <p>This workshop will get you up and crawling with Python! We’ll build fully-automated bots that traverse websites, or even the Internet at large, parsing and storing data as they go. This workshop will show you how to make the Internet your own personal API, collecting entire websites of content, statistics, and media in just minutes (and a few dozen lines of code). We’ll work with Python 3.4, and open source libraries including BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, and Requests.</p> <p>A brief outline of the the topics covered, and the code you’ll be writing:</p> <p>Overview of libraries, scraping environments, best practices<br/>Discussion of the best legal and ethical practices around web scraping and crawling, dispelling some common misconceptions and looking at several important cases.<br/>Scraping a single page of data and parsing HTML<br/>Exception handling and building crawlers that can handle the messy web without dying<br/>Traversing a list of pages, handling URL generation and pagination<br/>Writing crawlers with good data models and and software architectures, for maximum convenience and minimum code maintenance. Write once, crawl anywhere! <br/>Types of crawler movement patterns: recursion, random walks, moving through internal and external links. When to use them, and how to modify them for your own needs.<br/>Handling forms, logins, and other common crawler challenges<br/>Using Selenium + PhantomJS for crawling, JavaScript execution, and website testing<br/>Writing crawlers with Scrapy (Python 2.x). Pros and cons of this library, covering its advanced HTML selector tools, logging, and data output formats</p> <p>We’ll also have time for Q&amp;A, which may include additional advanced material, time-permitting, and looking at other tools and libraries to overcome common crawler challenges.</p> <p>Registration at: <a href=""https://web-crawling-austin.eventbrite.com""><a href=""https://web-crawling-austin.eventbrite.com"" class=""linkified"">https://web-crawling-austin.eventbrite.com</a></a></p> <p><br/><b>Requirements and Recommendations</b><br/>To get the most out of this workshop, I recommend that you be somewhat familiar with Python, have a Python 3.4 environment up and running on your machine, and know how to run scripts and install new Python libraries. Note that the exercises involving Scrapy will be using Python 2.7 (Scrapy is in the process of supporting Python 3.3+), so if you’d like to use this, you will need to have Python 2.7 also installed.</p> <p>If you would like to write your crawler output to MySQL, or another database, please have the server installed and running on your machine. You will have the option of using a database, or outputting to CSV (or another format) for several of the exercises.</p> <p><b>Instructor Bio:</b></p> <p>Ryan Mitchell is Software Engineer at LinkeDrive in Boston, where she develops their API and data analysis tools.

If your company would like to host this event, send me a note. - Lynn</i></p> <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>R, a statistical programming language, is used heavily by data scientists, data analysts, and academics across multiple fields and domains. In this workshop we’ll learn how to pair R with a graph database, in particular Neo4j, for the purposes of analyzing the data stored in the graph.</p> <p><br/>In the first half of the workshop we’ll focus on the integration that allows users to query data from Neo4j into R. This will include a Neo4j primer, a walkthrough of Cypher—a graph query language—and finally the process of pulling Cypher query results into R data frames via the RNeo4j package.</p> <p><br/>In the second half of the workshop we’ll focus on analyzing data in R. This will include plotting in ggplot2, graph algorithms in igraph, graph visualizations in visNetwork, and finally an interactive application powered by Shiny, a web framework for R.</p> <p><b>Speaker Bio</b></p> <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolemargaretwhite"">Nicole White</a> (<a href=""http://twitter.com/_nicolemargaret"">@_nicolemargaret</a>) grew up in Kansas City, Missouri.

"<p><i>For all of those who weren't able to catch it at <a href=""http://graphday.com"">Graph Day</a>, we're offering an encore presentation of Josh Perryman's Graph Database Engine shoot out. This is a great talk with a surprising conclusion.</i></p> <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Our client’s legacy system held graph-like data in a relational database, but new customers’ data sizes were crippling performance and scale. As part of an overall architectural rejuvenation, we evaluated migrating their data to graph and relational schemas to determine if query performance and scalability could be improved. With representative data in hand, we designed alternate relational schemas, graph database designs, and triple store designs, benchmarking performance and noting subjective measures such as ease-of-use and fluency of the query language. Vendors included PostgreSQL, Neo4J, Titan, and AllegroGraph. Follow-up studies included other vendors. The results surprised us, leading to a hybrid relational and graph recommendation. We have implemented the first milestone over the last year. Follow-up work shows that graph DB vendors have come a long way even in that time. This methodology and information in this case study should be useful to teams choosing a database engine, whether graph or relational, for their next project.</p> <p><br/><b>Speaker Bio</b></p> <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/josh-perryman/8/20/565"">Josh Perryman</a> (<a href=""https://twitter.com/joshperryman"">@joshperryman</a>) likes to play with data. Oftentimes this is implementing proprietary algorithms closer to the data for performance or scale. Sometimes it is ad-hoc investigation and analysis, a sort of exploratory querying. A few times he’s been able to leverage his experience with data engines for dramatic performance improvements. But the real joy is designing a schema for both functionality and performance, one which increases the productivity of other developers and enables a technology to solve new problems or deliver new value to the business.<br/>But technology isn't just data, and he does more than just play with data. He’s worked with high performance computing (HPC) environments, taking computations from hours to minutes or seconds. He has built visualizations which deliver new insights into complex data domains. He’s managed technology personnel, both directly and indirectly, to deliver technology solutions. He’s have put together more types of technology components, software and hardware, than can be counted, because one of his fortes is solving problems by building sustainable systems.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>6:30 Networking</p> <p>7:00 Featured talk</p> <p>8:45 Adjourn to pub</p>",Austin Data Geeks,ENCORE: Graph Database Engine Shoot-out,1455669000000

Access to the internet outside of class. During the class, students will be able to access class MySQL server and manipulate their data. Classes will primarily be a review of the concepts and interactive group problem solving.</p> <p><b>MySQL Associates Certification</b></p> <p>After taking this course, the student will be prepared to review the MySQL 5.0 Certification Guide. The topics covered in the course will actually cover more advanced topics than strictly required for the Associate certification. Some of the tedious details from the certification are skipped in the course because they are not helpful on a daily basis for using MySQL.</p> <p><b>Materials</b></p> <p>We will announce the text book for the class in the next week.

"<p><i>Special thanks to the generous folks at Cloudera Austin for hosting this event.</i></p> <p>Nick Gaylord, featured Data Day speaker, is coming back to Austin. We've invited him to spend an evening to share the latest on active learning. If your company would like to host this talk, send a note to <a href=""mailto:[masked]"">meetup at geekaustin dot org</a>.</p> <p><br/><b>ABSTRACT</b></p> <p>Active learning is an increasingly popular technique for rapidly iterating the construction of machine learning models. Models built using active learning require decreasing amounts of additional training data over time, because the current state of the model can be used to predict which additional examples will be the most informative. Active learning is appealing for two main reasons: it optimizes ongoing human involvement in the model building process, and it helps overcome the negative effects of imbalanced training data.In this talk, I discuss how CrowdFlower has drawn inspiration from active learning in the development of our new offering, CrowdFlower AI. By coupling a machine learning environment with our human data collection platform, we enable a highly efficient workflow whereby items that are classified with low confidence can be automatically re-routed to receive human annotations. This yields more accurate classification of those specific items, as well as additional, targeted training data for the model. </p> <p><br/><b>ABOUT THE SPEAKER</b></p> <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/nicholas-gaylord/31/26/9b7"">Nicholas Gaylord</a> is Senior Data Scientist at <a href=""http://crowdflower.com/"">CrowdFlower</a>, where he helps build out their new machine learning offering, CrowdFlower AI. CrowdFlower AI allows data scientists to construct, monitor, and improve machine learning models using data collected at scale from human contributors via the CrowdFlower platform, in a tightly integrated human-in-the-loop active learning environment. Prior to CrowdFlower, Nick was a data scientist at SF text analytics startup Idibon. He has a PhD from the University of Texas at Austin, where his research focused on human language comprehension and the construction of datasets for NLP applications. In his spare time he fixes bikes and collaborates on work applying cognitive science principles to the public health domain.</p> <p><br/><b>AGENDA</b></p> <p>6:30PM - Networking <br/>7:00PM - Featured talk / Q&amp;A <br/>8:30PM - Adjourn to pub</p>",Austin Data Geeks,Building better models faster using active learning - with Nick Gaylord,1472513400000

"<p>Two great talks for February.</p> <p>


First up, <b>Minesh Patel</b>, Sr. Solutions Architect at <b>Qubole</b></p> <p><b>Getting it Right: How to Scale Big Data in the Cloud</b></p> <p>In this presentation, I will discuss why Big Data belongs in the cloud, focusing on new ways in which growing data teams at companies like Pinterest and Gearbox can create and consume data insights and applications. With a focus on agility and flexibility, the cloud provides companies with a mechanism to keep up with change and stay competitive in today’s world of fast moving technologies. Minesh will cover real-world use cases, platform selection criteria, and best practices for implementing a successful big data production based on successful Qubole customers.</p> <p>Many data-driven businesses are evaluating deployments of advanced analytics solutions in the cloud vs. on premises. There are key decisions to make when building your data and analytics infrastructure, such as: How long should you plan for implementation? How dynamically scalable is your infrastructure, up or down? How do you ensure self-service access to data? And what are the risks and benefits of either approach for security and compliance?</p> <p><i>Qubole</i></p> <p>Qubole’s enterprise-ready Big Data platform is optimized for petabyte+ scale in your choice of AWS, Google, or Azure Cloud environments. Once IT sets policies, any number of data analysts can be set free to collaboratively “click to query” with the power of Hive, Spark, Presto, and many others in a growing list of data processing engines.</p> <p><br/>Next up, <b>Elias Ponvert,</b> Director of Data Science at<b> People Pattern</b></p> <p>I'll be presenting LeVar, a service and tools we've developed for managing machine learning evaluation datasets. LeVar begins to address an important but underdiscussed problem in pratical machine learning engineering -- managing the data you need to evaluate your models over time. Too often, in the interest of rapid turn-around, new methods and ML models are evaluated with temporary data, and it's unfortunately often too easy to forget to preserve evaluation data -- and actual evaluations -- for later use. Even if evaluation data is held safe and constant, and long term results are maintained and tracked, often only high-level summary statistics are maintained, making it difficult to perform comparative error analysis between current and older versions of ML models.</p> <p>LeVar solves these problems by making it easy to manage evaluation data and upload new experimental results as they become available. As a simple REST service, LeVar remains totally agnostic about the ML (or other) techniques used for each experiment's predictions.</p> <p>​I'll discuss LeVar goals, the functionality now supported in the first public release (0.1), and plans for future data formats, client libraries and features. </p> <p><i>People Pattern</i></p> <p>People Pattern is a Software as a Service platform that supplies meaningful Audience Insights to the world’s biggest brands.

While current AI limitations will certainly improve with time, using human computation lets us bulid applications which deliver superior results today.  Just as cloud computing now enables us to harness vast Internet computing resources on demand, new <i>crowdsourcing </i>APIsenable us to build computing systems which integrate human computation at run-time, invoking crowd labor on-demand and at-scale. Moreover, we can achieve the best of both worlds by integrating automated AI with human computation, creating hybrid systems with capabilities greater than the sum of their parts. When AI falls short, not only can human computation meet the immediate end-user need, but the results can be fed back into the system to further improve the AI. As a consequence, AI limitations are no longer a bottleneck to delivering innovative, new applications. Such enhanced capabilities have begun to change how we design and implement intelligent systems. While early work in crowd computing focused only on collecting more data from crowds to better train AI, we are increasingly seeing hybrid, socio-computational system emerge which creatively blend human computation and AI at run-time to solve hard computing problems. As such, we find ourselves today in an exhilarating new design space in which intelligent system capabilities are seemingly limited only by our imagination and creativity in designing new algorithms to compute effectively using crowds as well as silicon.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:</p> <p>Matthew Lease is organizing the AAAI Human Computation (HCOMP) conference in Austin, TX in Fall 2016 and invites industry participation (<a href=""http://www.humancomputation.com/2016/""><a href=""http://www.humancomputation.com/2016/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.humancomputation.com/2016/</a></a>)  Prof. Lease is an Associate Professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

There is free parking in the garage across the street from the building. When you arrive, take the elevator to the 2nd floor where you will check in with security. You will need to RSVP so security has your name.</p> <p><b>Schedule</b></p> <p>6:00pm: Doors open, food and drinks provided.</p> <p>6:15pm - 7:00pm: Generating personalized travel recommendations from natural language queries - Melanie Tosik</p> <p>7:00pm - 7:45pm:  Scaling Data Science in Python - Christine Doig Cardet</p> <p>7:45pm - 8:00pm - Mingle with data folks!</p> <p><b>Talk 1:</b>   Generating personalized travel recommendations from natural language queries - Melanie Tosik</p> <p><br/><b>Abstract:</b> Travel planning can be very time-consuming. At WayBlazer, we are striving to provide travelers with a single platform to dynamically deliver personalized hotel recommendations. All that is left to the user is to describe their desired travel experience in natural language. For example, you could ask ""Where are the best hotels in the Caribbean for my honeymoon in June"", or ""I want a pet-friendly hotel in Ireland with access to a great golf course"". In order to generate recommendations that are most relevant to the user query, WayBlazer leverages a number of internal and external NLP and ML services. As opposed to a traditional tf-idf search (a statistical measure to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a given corpus), our discovery tool is powered by a graph database similar to ConceptNet 5. This talk will give the audience an overview of WayBlazer's basic technology tack, as well as a deep dive into our NL search technology.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b>  Melanie Tosik is an NLP research engineer at WayBlazer. Her team focuses on developing complex, real-world applications of natural language processing and machine learning. Melanie spends most of her time designing and implementing semantic microservices which accurately extract context, intent and relevant concepts from natural language queries. In addition, Melanie employs a variety of machine learning algorithms to enrich user queries with vast amounts of previously unstructured data.</p> <p>


<b>Talk 2:</b> Scaling Data Science in Python - Christine Doig Cardet</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> The PyData ecosystem is great for doing data science. Packages like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Bokeh provide an excellent interface to doing complicated computations on datasets, building predictive models or making interactive data visualizations. With only a few lines of code one can load some data into a dataframe, clean it, build a predictive model and plot the results. However, this workflow starts to falter when working with data that’s larger than the memory on your computer.<br/>At Continuum Analytics we are developing open source libraries, like Dask, Numba, and Datashader, that help data scientists scale their PyData analysis to improve performance and use larger amounts of data. By using the existing Python ecosystem, we are standing upon the shoulders of giants. Users can smoothly adapt their code without needing to completely change technologies or frameworks.<br/>In this talk Christine will present ways those libraries can help data scientists scale their workflows, from exploratory analysis, to predictive models and visualizations.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b> Christine Doig is a Senior Data Scientist at Continuum Analytics, where she has worked, among other projects, on MEMEX, a DARPA-funded project helping stop human trafficking. She has 5+ years of experience in analytics, operations research, and machine learning in a variety of industries, including energy, manufacturing, and banking. Christine holds a M.S. in Industrial Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona. Christine loves empowering people through open source technologies, and has been a speaker at conferences like PyCon, PyData, EuroPython and SciPy.</p>",Austin Data,NLP for Travel Recommendations and Scaling Data Science in Python,1468882800000

Not because we lack the skills but because time constraints, limited budgets and eagerness to get to the next feature often results crappy workarounds, bipolar documentation and very little test coverage - if any at all. Speed up your development with spec-driven code generation. <a href=""https://autocode.run/"">Autocode</a> is an open source code generator you can teach to multiply yourself and quickly generate perfect code - the way you see it. Your design patterns, your coding style, your opinionated development. Beyond project scaffolding, beyond boilerplate code, beyond REST APIs. </p> <p>Chris Tate, creator of <a href=""https://autocode.run/"">Autocode</a>, will walk you through the code generation lifecycle and show you how to create custom generators for all the things. Even though Autocode is language agnostic, this will be all about Node.js. Chris will demonstrate generating code for over 50+ Node projects including npm, Grunt, Gulp, Sails, Express, Hapi, Locomotive, Strapi, Karma, Mocha, Sequelize, Waterline, Mongoose, Bookshelf, Caminte, Bower, Browser Sync and more.</p> <p><br/>About Chris:</p> <p>Chris has been writing code for 19 years and is based here in Austin.</p>","Node.JS User Group - Austin, TX",Perfecting Node with Autocode,1455843600000

To keep up it is important to start with a good foundation. This talk will go through some of the mistakes we made at StreamMe, and what we have learned. Hopefully getting everyone to a place where they feel like they could start a new project on Node that will last for more than a month at a startup.</p> <p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/wesleytodd/646550efb35b5afd6c09975a19037fb7#soa"">&lt;/a&gt; <b>SOA</b></p> <p>New features will happen, and development of them should not be hindered legacy code and practices. Writing your apps in a service oriented architecture can help with this. It means that when you start a new feature you can choose new tools and updated versions of tools and libraries.</p> <p>&lt;a href=""https://gist.github.com/wesleytodd/646550efb35b5afd6c09975a19037fb7#build-your-apps-without-dependencies""&gt;</a> <b>Build your apps without dependencies</b></p> <p>As your application grows there will be infrastructure pieces and configuration that changes, often based on the server environment (dev, pre-production, production). Build your integrations to these in such a way that they are easily decoupled.</p> <p>Also, try to make sure that they do not have any environment or external dependencies during development. That means all development configuration should be bundled into the source code repository. That also means your persistence layers and infrastructure should be either optional, or easily run separately for development.</p> <p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/wesleytodd/646550efb35b5afd6c09975a19037fb7#setup-a-local-npm"">&lt;/a&gt; <b>Setup a local NPM</b></p> <p>There will come a point where you have some code shared between your applications. Probably on day 2. In the past this, there was a hard decision to make, should you setup and maintain your own internal NPM. I say in the past because now it is easy to setup and run because of NPM Inc's NPM On-Site.</p> <p>This also solves a large security issue that was recently publicized with the left-pad package issue. Because you are running a local copy you reduce your risk of falling victim to malicious packages. A local NPM in combination with npm shrink wrap means that you can rely on reproducable builds and secure code.</p> <p><br/>About Wes:</p> <p>Wes is a Michigan transplant who loved the scene in Austin, so decided to move here.  He is the Lead Developer of the Front-End Team at Stream.me, and has worked on full-stack Node applications for the past 3 years.  He currently focuses on writing isomorphic React applications and participates quite a bit in the Express community.</p> <p><br/>&lt;a href=""https://github.com/wesleytodd""&gt;<a href=""https://github.com/wesleytodd"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/wesleytodd</a></a><br/><a href=""https://twitter.com/wesleytodd""><a href=""https://twitter.com/wesleytodd"" class=""linkified"">https://twitter.com/wesleytodd</a></a><br/><a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/~wesleytodd""><a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/~wesleytodd"" class=""linkified"">https://www.npmjs.com/~wesleytodd</a></a></p>","Node.JS User Group - Austin, TX",Architecting Node apps at a startup.,1461283200000

You may want to run it as a long-running web service. Under normal circumstances, you would end up in a callback pyramid of doom, but through the clever use of generator systems, such as AMPHP and Icicle, you can make building asynchronous code (the backbone of a long-running PHP web server) reasonably sane. We will learn how these systems use generators and how to build logic on top of these packages to build blindingly fast, maintainable apps.</p> <p>

Unfortunately, most startups being formed today focus on squeezing profit out of solving small problems, for small markets. If bright-minded entrepreneurs tackled bigger problems and global markets, not only would their potential to achieve big profit AND societal impact be much higher - they could also lead a more inspired and passionate life. </p> <p>On this free, interactive webinar, we will discuss various topics around creating an impactful company with special guest Kimbal Musk. </p> <p>Kimbal Musk is on the board for Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. His personal mission is to strengthen communities through food.

The Kitchen Community builds Learning Gardens in schools around the U.S. reaching hundreds of thousands of students every school day, improving their vegetable intake and academic achievements. </p> <p>During this event, Adeo Ressi (Founder &amp; CEO of the Founder Institute) and Kimbal will discuss topics like:  </p> <p>• The various business opportunities where entrepreneurs can start impactful companies </p> <p>• How to identify the ""big idea"" that you are passionate about solving </p> <p>• How to create an impactful vision, define your mission, and articulate them to the masses</p> <p>• How to navigate the funding landscape for social and mission-driven companies</p> <p>• Why food is an impactful and trillion dollar business opportunity </p> <p>We hope you will join us!</p> <p><i>--- </i></p> <p><i>This is a free, online event that you can participate in from your computer.

See you there!</p> <p>As a teacher or school leader, you are on the front lines of education. You see it all - the good and the bad, the problems and the possibilities. And you have unique insights into new and better ways of doing education. But what happens then? When can you take time to build your insight into a solution? Who will support you? And most importantly, how do you take your idea and turn it into a sustainable program, process or product?</p> <p><br/>This hands-on/on-your-feet workshop is for teachers and also early-stage entrepreneurs who hold a vision for improving some facet of school life but who are less clear on the pathway to actualize that vision. Taking several pages from startup methodology, we’ll step through methods to clarify your solution, map your landscape of assets and challenges and construct a plan that you can start working on right away. We’ll share online tools to help you organize, plan and stay connected to like-minded peers building their own solutions.</p> <p><br/>This workshop is all about teacher leadership and building schools from the inside. It’s about educators creating local solutions to local problems.

"<p>EdTech Austin is excited to announce our first Satellite Meetup. In an effort to reach members of EdTech Austin in growing areas of the metropolitan area, we will be hosting periodic events in other parts of the greater Austin region.</p> <p><br/>The start of the school year is an exciting time for students and educators. Getting the school year off to a smooth start takes lots of planning, especially in the area of technology. From teachers, administrators, instructional technology staff as well as technology vendors and providers, many have been working since the last school year ended and all through the summer in preparation. How do you ensure that your tech is ready for students and teachers to use when they’ve returned to school? What expectations do teachers, students and parents have around technology? What tasks have to be completed over the summer? What should technology providers plan for to engage with school districts?</p> <p><br/>Learn from a panel of education technologist, EdTech providers and teachers about all the work that goes into getting the year off to a good start. In addition to focusing on your personal learning and expanding your network, we’ll discuss new preparation themes to consider for the fall, such as digital citizenship. Come prepared with questions and ready to share your best practices.</p> <p>Our panel consists of Lacy Bartlett, Innovative Teaching Strategist, Manor ISD; Cori Coburn-Shiflett, Digital Learning Coach, Georgetown ISD; Joni Carswell, President, LivingTree; Lannon Heflin, Director of Instructional Technology, Round Rock ISD: and Victor Valdez, Executive Director of Technology, Pflugerville ISD. The panel will be moderated by Patricia Fowler, co-founder of Education Project Management Consulting group (@educationpmc).</p> <p><br/>As always, we’ll provide food to keep your brains firing on all cylinders.</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p>-The EdTech Austin Team</p> <p>

"<p>EdTech Austin is hosting its second Satellite meeting on Wednesday, November 2 at 6pm, on Data Privacy in K12. In an effort to reach members of EdTech Austin in growing areas of the metropolitan area, we will be hosting periodic events in other parts of the greater Austin region. We are pleased to be hosted by TechRanch for this meetup.</p> <p>Over the years, the presence of technology has increased significantly in classrooms. From assessments, to curriculum, to collaboration and research, technology is pervasive across grade levels in school districts across the country. With the increased use of technology, particularly web based products, protection of student data is becoming more critical.</p> <p>EdTech vendors need to be aware of and adhere to the laws and regulations surrounding student data and privacy. As individual teachers, schools and districts engage with more and new technology, an awareness of the laws and a willingness to press vendors for more information is necessary. Everyone involved needs to be well versed in student data privacy. The ultimate goal is to protect students as we continue to integrate technology into education.</p> <p>Learn from a few great presenters on this topic including Emily Tabatabai, a data privacy attorney. She is a start-up and emerging company specialist who understands how to help companies realize their product vision while avoiding pesky privacy or consumer protection problems. She has presented extensively on the topics of COPPA and FERPA. If you’re in the EdTech space and don’t know what those acronyms mean, then you should definitely attend.</p> <p>Also presenting will be Ryan Hopkins, principal at Lanier HS in Austin ISD who will speak about privacy issues in schools and communicating with students, parents and teachers. We will also hear from Mark Gabehart, who is Executive Director of Management Information Systems for Round Rock ISD. Mark will speak to the issues districts face while dealing with K12 data privacy.</p> <p><br/>As always, we’ll provide food and beverages to keep your brain firing on all cylinders so you can actively participate in this great conversation. Education Project Management Consulting (EPMC) is pleased to be a sponsor of this meetup.</p>",EdTech Austin,UNDERSTANDING DATA PRIVACY IN K12,1478127600000

"<p>Join <a href=""http://www.emberitas.com/"">Emberitas </a>for a day workshop! </p> <p><b>Register and read more on the official event page <a href=""http://www.emberitas.com/"">here</a>. </b></p> <p>



Emberitas is a free one-day workshop to teach women Ember.js. The two-track workshop includes a course for women who are new to code (and will focus on principles of MVC and Object Oriented Programming through the lens of Ember.js) as well as a more advanced track for women who are already familiar with a backend or frontend MVC framework and want to learn more about what Ember has to offer.</p> <p>Why are we doing this? The Ember community is uniquely welcoming, supportive, and genuine. As just one example of how Ember stands out among tech communities, 33% of EmberConf 2016 speakers were women.</p> <p>However, EmberATX’s female meetup attendance is pretty dismal! As a community, we’re actively looking for ways to fix this and we realized we simply need more Ember developers in Austin.</p> <p>When women find welcoming communities in tech, they stay in the industry longer.</p> <p>That’s why an event like Emberitas is so important, and why we're excited to see you there on July 16th, 2016.</p> <p>


<b>Schedule</b></p> <p>9:00 - 10:15 - Check-In, Breakfast, and computer set up </p> <p>10:15 - 10:45 - Welcome and Introductions</p> <p>11:00 - 12:45 - Morning Session </p> <p>12:45 - 1:30 - Lunch </p> <p>1:30 - 2:15 - Lunch continues, with Lightning Talks from Featured Sponsors and Community Members, Mid-Day Ice Breakers</p> <p>2:15 - 5:45 - Afternoon Session</p> <p>6pm+ Community Happy Hour (Offsite - Location TBD)</p> <p>


<b>Registration Policy:</b></p> <p>The workshop can accommodate up to 40 attendees. <b>Register <a href=""http://www.emberitas.com/"">here</a></b>. </p> <p>20 in the beginner workshop: no or very limited experience with code. Perhaps some experimentation with html, css, and javascript, but not required. </p> <p>20 attendees in the intermediate workshop: Some experience manipulating the DOM using javascript, OR experience with an MVC framework in javascript or a server-side programming language.</p> <p>Registration priority will be given to individuals identifying as female. Prospective male attendees will be added to a wait list and will be contacted in the order of registration if space becomes available before the event. We will attempt to confirm attendance from registrants in the week before the event, and will notify wait list attendees no less than 24 hours before the event.</p>",The Iron Yard Austin,Emberitas: 1-Day Workshop on Ember.js,1468677600000

"<p>6:30-7:00 networking and food</p> <p><br/>7:00-8:00 Presentation </p> <p><br/>In 2013, IBM launched a new initiative to transform our culture from engineering-led to design-led. Part of design thinking is having focused targets to design for, but at IBM, we provide solutions for diverse audiences spread across industries. Our problem: the construct of the traditional persona (for individuals) didn’t reflect the team dynamics we saw in our user interviews. We found we were talking about the arena in terms of the needs of individuals, when the ecosystem they worked in was defining their work. But the ecosystem is huge—too huge for our team to ingest. So we created team-based personas to capture these dynamics.</p> <p><br/>These personas better portray the team dynamics and reflect the greater complexity of our broad user base, and so we wanted a better way for our team to learn this data. Instead of performing traditional analysis and reporting the results to our team, we brought them into the persona creation process so that different team members with different perspectives could come up with implications together. This process resulted in a defined set of design principles that everyone understood and owned.</p> <p>In this case study, you will learn how one team took traditional persona practices and adapted them to a new framework, where researchers become facilitators for the rest of their team. Designers and researchers who work in enterprise systems will learn how they can adopt this model to bring focus and alignment around their users using team-based personas.</p> <p><br/><img src=""http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/eventprovider/1/_@user_216349.jpg"" /></p> <p><b>Julia Zorzanello Byron</b></p> <p>IBM Corporation</p> <p>Julia Zorzanello Byron, an idealistic industrial designer, switched to software when she saw the opportunity to practice and spread empathic design at IBM.

"<p>There is a belief in the UX community that user personas can be either fast or rigorous, but not both. We present a fast and rigorous method based on cluster analysis of surveyed user traits (e.g. behaviors, attitudes). First, we build a survey to measure the space of user traits. Second, we submit the survey data to factor analysis to find groups of correlated traits. Third, we submit the factor scores to cluster analysis to identify groups of users who have similar traits. We demonstrate the method in the context of developing car shopper personas. We suggest best practices for building a meaningful survey, interpreting the factors, optimizing the clusters, and visualizing the results.</p> <p><b>Speakers</b></p> <p>Stefania Mereu is a User Experience (UX) Researcher, Strategist, Evangelist &amp; Data Visualization addict.

"<p>Conducting user research has increasingly become an accepted and expected part of the development process among firms, from those building consumer websites to enterprise applications. This is great news for users! However, this also means that user research can become a box-checking activity, leading to research that fails to deliver on the promise of insights and impact that can positively shape both the strategy and tactical implementations of products and interfaces.</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll explore how a focus on building a Story around your research activities can lead to greater stakeholder buy-in, use of methods that better match research and business objectives, and can increase the relevancy of research results and how those results are communicated. </p> <p><b>Speaker</b></p> <p>Rob Dixon is a UX Research Strategist at Human Interfaces, Inc.

"<p>We have two talks this month - one on containers and one on online authentication!</p> <p><b>What Are Containers And Why Are They So Important, by Derrick Wippler</b></p> <p>Struggling to understand all the hype around Docker? Don't understand the difference between a VM and a container? Why are immutable operating systems cool? Why is everyone going crazy over Kubernetes/Swarm/Apache Mesos? </p> <p>This talk will attempt to inform by pulling back the curtain on the container hype. We will dissect what a container is, why clustering containers and orchestration matters, immutable operating systems and finally where this is all going and how it will effect your future interaction with the cloud. </p> <p>Derrick Wippler is: Tech Geek, Container evangelist, Software Developer, Entrepreneur and Rackspace Cloud Block Storage Imagineer.

But the best way to reduce user-friction is to never require a person to authenticate. This talk will provide a modern solution to reconcile these two divergent imperatives by leveraging standard profiles of OAuth2 for trust elevation.

A common complaint from data science managers is that data scientists invest time prototyping algorithms, and throw them over a proverbial fence to engineers to implement, only to find the algorithms must be rebuilt from scratch to scale. This is a symptom of a broader ailment -- that data teams are often designed as functional silos without proper communication and planning.</p> <p>This talk outlines a framework to build and organize a data team that produces better results, minimizes wasted effort among team members, and ships great data products.</p> <p><br/><b>Meet Your Speaker: </b><br/><a href=""http://twitter.com/ryanorban""><b>Ryan Orban</b></a> is the EVP of Product and Strategy at <a href=""http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/""><b>Galvanize</b></a>.

It is also a great success story for scalable Machine Learning. </p> <p>In this talk, we discuss the Kaggle competetion on click through rate prediction, which is an important metric for evaluating online ad performance. Using the dataset from Kaggle, we use Spark MLLib to create a pipeline for data parsing, feature extraction, model creation, model evaluation and finally prediction.""</p> <p><b>Prerequisites / Level: </b><br/>This is an Intermediate level talk, where attendee is expected to know the basics of Spark and Machine Learning.</p> <p><b>Meet Your Speaker: </b><br/>Manisha Sule is a software engineer currently working with IBM's Spark Technology Center.

The cardinal symptom of Rb is called leukocoria, or ""white eye"". Leukocoria is often ignored by parents and overlooked by doctors. This leads to late diagnosis of Rb in many children, which greatly decreases survivors' quality of life. We trained deep neural networks to detect this symptom and alert parents when the symptom is found. We've deployed our technology in an iOS app and an Android app, and the app has already lead to some early diagnosis. This work is ongoing.</p> <p><br/><b>Meet the speaker: </b></p> <p>Ryan Henning ran a machine learning contracting business (rhobota.com), and is also involved in a local startup (rhovo.com).

At the root of successful “selling” of an idea is an understanding of the objective functions of the audience. That is, why do they care about what you have to say? What is the opportunity cost of inaction? Convincing management of the value of advanced analytics on streaming data will become even more important in the growing field of IOT and online learning. In IOT and online learning, it will be especially useful to emphasize the aggregate impact of an improvement to modeling lift and make your case accordingly. </p> <p>Ken is an Analytics Architect and Evangelist at H2O.

"<p>A Blockchain Tutorial: Technology Basics, Business Use Cases, and Live Demos Presented by:</p> <p><br/><b>Dr. Siddhartha (“Sid”) Chatterjee, Chief Technology Officer, Persistent Systems</b></p> <p>Blockchain technology brings together several well-known computer science concepts in a unique manner, thereby enabling new kinds of applications and business models. It has gained a lot of attention in the last two years, fueling an entire ecosystem dedicated towards unleashing its full potential.</p> <p>The blockchain technology allows for maintenance of a shared distributed ledger (also known as the blockchain), which can be simultaneously read and modified by all involved parties while not being owned by any individual party. This can be implemented with absolutely no trust (as in the case of Bitcoin or Ethereum), or with limited amount of trust (as in the case of consortium blockchains, where a group of entities can control access to the blockchain).</p> <p>In this tutorial presentation, I will explain the basic concepts behind Bitcoin and blockchain technology, and demonstrate some business use cases across multiple industries that we have built at Persistent. Agenda:</p> <p>Doors open at 6pm for mingling and networking, and the program kicks off at 6.30pm with an opportunity for shoutouts, requests for help, etc.</p> <p>Then the main presentation will take place, followed by some demos based on different blockchain platforms, and Q&amp;A time.</p> <p>Following the Meetup, some of us may find a bar for further discussion.</p> <p>Note: You will need to sign in at Galvanize reception.

Beginning with Friday night pitches and continuing through brainstorming, business plan development, and basic prototype creation, STARTUP DRIVE culminates in Sunday night demos and presentations. Participants create working startups during the event and are able to collaborate with like-minded individuals outside of their daily networks. All teams hear talks by industry leaders and receive valuable feedback from local entrepreneurs. The weekend is centered around action, innovation, and education. Whether you are looking for feedback on a idea, a co-founder, specific skill sets, or a team to help you execute, STARTUP DRIVE is the perfect environment in which to test your idea and take the first steps towards launching your own startup.</p> <p><br/><b>Legal stuff:<br/></b>It is our job to provide you with an incredible networking and learning opportunity. Our intention is that you meet some amazing people that you might actually start a company with, build relationships with coaches, and learn from your peers. The event is intended to be a collaborative forum for sharing, learning, building, and having fun. As such, by registering as a participant, you acknowledge that any ideas shared by you or anyone else over the course of the event are contributions to the overall experience and community. If you as a participant are worried about someone stealing your ideas, please reconsider your participation in the event itself or simply refrain from sharing specifics about your idea. As a member of your startup community, you agree to to be inclusive of any and all people and their ideas. You agree to act professionally, treat everyone with respect, and treat the event facilities with proper care. You agree that you are responsible for any accidents or damages that you cause. You also agree to not hold STARTUP DRIVE, your local volunteer team, or any of the event supporters liable for any loss, damage, injury, or any other unforeseeable incident.

"<p>This month's meetup will be hosted at the new Galvanize campus in the 2nd street district. Please join us for food, drinks and enlightenment. We'll be migrating over to the Gingerman for an informal social event after the night's talks. Please see below for the lineup. I Can Write My App With No Handlebars</p> <p>In Ember, Handlebars is a small, Lisp-y templating language we use to express our application's user interface. We use Keywords, Helpers and Components and other primitives to build upon this language, and the result of this is a larger vocabulary in which we can declare our intent much more clearly. Let's explore how Keywords and Helpers augment Handlebars, and cover techniques and patterns for creating our own Helpers in good taste.</p> <p>In this talk, we'll cover everything from the Rule of Least Power, declarative templating, as well as patterns and anti-patterns of creating helpers.</p> <p>Lauren is a full-stack Senior Engineer at Netflix and DockYard alumnus. Although formally educated in Finance, she has been involved with user interface and experience design for more than 5 years. She is an active contributor to the Ember.js community, and a regular speaker at leading JavaScript and Elixir events and conferences.</p> <p><b>Fireside Chat with Lauren Tan</b></p> <p>Our inaugural Fireside Chat in which we will take questions from all over the Ember community and ask them to Lauren. Who knows what will happen. Do you want to know what her favorite sweet moves are in her text editor? What is her favorite Pokemon character? What's the real story behind that pirate hat? Send your question to us to find out! To top it all off, we're taking questions from everywhere and posting the video to the internet for all posterity. In order to submit questions, tweet @EmberATX with the hashtag #firesidechat. We'll be accepting questions up through the 25th!</p> <p>Don't forget to thank our wonderful sponsors! We'd like to give a big hug to our new venue sponsor, Galvanize, for hooking us up with a super sweet downtown location. We're incredibly excited about the new space!</p> <p>O'Rielly Media sent us a big ol' box of books that we'll be raffling off a few at a time until we run out :) Don't worry, there are still several coloring books left!</p> <p><b>Parking</b></p> <p>There is a paid garage in the Galvanize building that has reasonable prices after hours. We also recommend taking public transit, looking for street parking, parking in the surface lot at Guadalupe and 3rd or using the City Hall or Violet Crown parking garages.</p> <p><b>How to find us in the Galvanize building</b></p> <p>Take the elevator to the second floor to check in at the front desk. They will direct you to the correct lecture space.</p> <p><b>We'd love to hear from you!</b></p> <p>EmberATX is a community-organized event run by volunteers that are passionate about building an inclusive, inspiring tech community in Austin. We are always looking for new contributors. Please contact one of the organizers if you'd like to try your hand at speaking, want to sponsor one of our events or have some ideas about how to make our meetup amazing.</p>",Learn to Code Austin,Ember ATX Meetup,1469750400000

True story.)</p> <p><b> What it's all about (In media-friendly speak):<br/></b>STARTUP DRIVE is a national series of several 54-hour events designed to provide superior experiential education for technical and non-technical entrepreneurs. Beginning with Friday night pitches and continuing through brainstorming, business plan development, and basic prototype creation, STARTUP DRIVE culminates in Sunday night demos and presentations. Participants create working startups during the event and are able to collaborate with like-minded individuals outside of their daily networks. All teams hear talks by industry leaders and receive valuable feedback from local entrepreneurs. The weekend is centered around action, innovation, and education. Whether you are looking for feedback on a idea, a co-founder, specific skill sets, or a team to help you execute, STARTUP DRIVE is the perfect environment in which to test your idea and take the first steps towards launching your own startup.</p> <p><br/><b>Legal stuff:<br/></b>It is our job to provide you with an incredible networking and learning opportunity. Our intention is that you meet some amazing people that you might actually start a company with, build relationships with coaches, and learn from your peers. The event is intended to be a collaborative forum for sharing, learning, building, and having fun. As such, by registering as a participant, you acknowledge that any ideas shared by you or anyone else over the course of the event are contributions to the overall experience and community. If you as a participant are worried about someone stealing your ideas, please reconsider your participation in the event itself or simply refrain from sharing specifics about your idea. As a member of your startup community, you agree to to be inclusive of any and all people and their ideas. You agree to act professionally, treat everyone with respect, and treat the event facilities with proper care. You agree that you are responsible for any accidents or damages that you cause. You also agree to not hold STARTUP DRIVE, your local volunteer team, or any of the event supporters liable for any loss, damage, injury, or any other unforeseeable incident. By Participating at the event, you grant STARTUP DRIVE permission to capture photo/video of the event (if this makes you feel uncomfortable - please let us know.)</p> <p><br/><b>Refund Policy:<br/></b>No refunds will be granted within 7 days of the event *if* food and drink have already been ordered. (Though if you ask us, chances are we can connect you with someone who will buy it from you - there's usually a waiting list!)</p>",Learn to Code Austin,STARTUP DRIVE: Austin,1474668000000

"<p><b>Topic: DevOps and the Big O</b></p> <p>No, not that Big O.<br/>Or even whether to capitalize the O in 'Ops'</p> <p>The O in question is Orchestration - the complex effort of tying the varied processes along the chain together into one whole. Even in relatively mature organizations, there are multiple groups, multiple tracking tools, and pockets of automation that must function as a whole in order for DevOps techniques such as Continuous Delivery to operate. This is actually something that gets harder as the business is successful and begins to grow.</p> <p>So, our discussion will be focused on:<br/>- How you do it today?<br/>- What bottlenecks have you overcome?<br/>- What bottlenecks have proven insurmountable so far?<br/>- How is the evolution of your company / team / organization impacting your efforts?</p> <p>I hope you can make it!</p> <p><b>Speaker: Group</b></p> <p>d</p> <p><b>DevOps SIG Info:</b><br/>More information and communication may be found at the SIG's Google Group: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/agileaustin-devops""><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/agileaustin-devops"" class=""linkified"">http://groups.google.com/group/agileaustin-devops</a></a>.

"<p><b>Topic: Continuous Delivery at Iteration Zero with Jeffrey Palermo</b></p> <p>DevOps is a term representing the convergence of development and operations. Both the development and operations communities like to own the term, so it has accumulated multiple meanings. With the Agile Manifesto, developers have jettisoned annual software releases for processes that allow releasing software multiple times per day. To accomplish this, teams use rigorous suites of automated tests to ensure that every change to the software is a solid step forward rather than an accidental step backward.</p> <p>IterationZero is the period of time in a project where necessary infrastructure and processes are set up to yield the maximum velocity and throughput for a team.</p> <p>Since 2005, the word “continuous” has changed how teams develop, deploy, and run software. Starting with the impactful book, ""Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk"" by Paul Duvall, teams have increasingly moved from a world where work is done in large batches to a world where the same work is done in much smaller batches while being integrated with work adjacent to it. Many can remember a workflow where developers were assigned different parts of an application. They wrote code for weeks on end. Some might check the code in. Others might not. Regardless, the code wasn’t integrated even if it was checked in. The Agile movement brought with it technical practices from Extreme Programming, such as continuous integration and test-driven development. Now, teams that profess to be using Agile are known to have continuous integration servers that compile and run the tests of the software with every code check-in. With the cloud, Agile has moved beyond how to write the appropriate code, and the new DevOps movement (new as of 2010) carries the word “continuous” into new frontiers. These are called continuous delivery and continuous deployment.</p> <p>In this presentation, we'll cover how to set up your own continuous delivery pipeline very similar to how Microsoft's NuGet team manages NuGet.org. We will use the same chain of tools, and the same techniques.</p> <p><b>Speaker: Jeffrey Palermo</b></p> <p>Jeffrey Palermo is a Managing Partner and CEO of Clear Measure, an expert software engineering firm based in Austin, TX with employees across North America.

"<p><b>Topic: How to Avoid Ivory Tower Management</b></p> <p>Being a manager in a software organization can be quite different than being a manager in other industries. For instance, organizational skill is not enough. You can be the most organized person and able to coordinate project deadlines left and right, but if you don't understand the technology, failure will loom for you. But, is just knowing the technology your team is using enough?</p> <p>Our speaker today asserts that it is not, and will lead a discussion to talk about how technical managers and leaders can keep their hands dirty with the technology *in addition* to all of their leadership and management duties. We will dispel the myth that a manager is unable to code. We will talk about techniques for allowing our leaders to participate in development of product....and we will talk about all of the benefits from doing so.

He is an Agile pragmatist as he strives to help organizations become more effective in their technical and software development implementations while maintaining a high degree of quality. Lee received his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Southwest Texas State University. He is a Certified ScrumMaster and Trained Innovation Games Facilitator.

"<p><b>Topic: @ DrillingInfo: An evolutionary approach to scaled Kanban</b></p> <p>

Many organizations are unaware of the benefits of Kanban. DrillingInfo was one of these companies. Using LKU's techniques and approach to evolutionary change has created a revolution in the organization. Starting with one kanban team, lead times, graphs, and slide decks has led to a viral adoption of Kanban that has reached the desk of the CTO, President and COO. This session will share the case study of a Kanban transformation of a $100 million private technology energy company and what techniques were used to drive influence to change.</p> <p>

<b>Speaker: Jay Paulson</b></p> <p>

Jay is a Software Development Manager at DrillingInfo. He has been in software development for over 15 years. Early he realized that it was very difficult to create high quality software quickly. 7 years ago he found Kanban and has been hooked since. He has implemented Kanban for 5+ years at several different companies such as IBM, eBay, startups, and large private companies such as DrillingInfo.</p> <p>

His open source application, LeanSheets, has had a direct impact on the adoption of Kanban across organizations showing what can be learned from lead time data. The data and visualization has helped Jay lead the Kanban transform at DrillingInfo in all levels of the company. He is looking forward to showing the company how it can help in other areas as traction is still gaining throughout DrillingInfo through his monthly corporate wide Kanban training sessions.</p> <p>

"<p><b>Topic: How Yahoo! Embraced Automated Testing</b></p> <p>Problem/Strategy:</p> <p>Yahoo! strives to create highly personalized experiences for its users, and keep people connected to what matters most to them, across devices and around the world. To meet the demands of its users and continually introduce new updates and features, Yahoo! Mail adopted an agile modern software development framework that required automated testing as development teams checked in new code multiple times a day.</p> <p>At one point the Yahoo! Mail team was hung up with testing infrastructure problems – a common problem for organizations in the business of writing user-facing code and not maintaining test infrastructure. The team maintained a grid of VMs, making it harder to run thousands of tests in parallel. In addition to constantly maintaining test infrastructure, another challenge was adding templates for new OS web browsers. This took considerable time, requiring assembly OS images and the security team to approve those images and hardware such as VMs. In order to keep up with the competition, the Yahoo! Mail team realized it had to adopt to the latest, modern application testing technology – automated testing – to increase its software release frequency and quality.</p> <p>Solution:<br/>By adopting this type of testing tool, Yahoo! Mail was able to concentrate on writing user-facing product code, instead of getting tied up with maintaining test infrastructure to support new browser versions.</p> <p>Join Neil Manvar, professional services lead at Sauce Labs and former software engineer at Yahoo! for this session on Yahoo!’s previous web application testing challenges and how they were solved. You’ll learn strategies on building faster and higher quality apps and solutions designed to dramatically reduce time and energy spent worrying about infrastructure. By embracing automation testing, learn how Yahoo! has been able to stay connected with users in this rapid, ‘mobile-first’ era – a challenge many organizations today face.</p> <p>Attendees will leave with the following takeaways:</p> <p>How Yahoo! Mail harnessed automated testing to maintain its test infrastructure, giving back more time and energy for the team to focus on other vital business operations.</p> <p>How the shift towards cloud-based services, open-source technologies, and developers who write QA code is changing the face of Yahoo!.</p> <p>Industry insights into how automation tools today promote testing effectiveness without increasing costs, thereby improving the QA—development relationships, bringing everyone closer to a real-time testing environment.</p> <p><b>Speaker: Neil Manvar</b></p> <p>Neil serves as Professional Services Lead for Sauce Labs. Prior, he served at Yahoo! as a software engineer where he contributed to various Yahoo! Mail features such as compose, attachments, mail search, among other projects. He was one of the first software engineers to set up Yahoo! Mail’s Continuous Delivery build infrastructure and pipelines, and worked to develop an automated functional testing framework leveraging Cucumber, Page-Object, Watir-Webdriver, Sauce Labs and other technologies to run tests parallel on various browsers.</p> <p><b>QA SIG North Info:</b><br/>More information and communication may be found at the SIG's Google Group: <a href=""http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agileaustinqasig/""><a href=""http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agileaustinqasig/"" class=""linkified"">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agileaustinqasig/</a></a>.

"<p><b>Topic: ChatOps for Developers</b></p> <p>This month Lee Fox will be leading us in a discussion about ChatOps...</p> <p>ChatOps is an operational methodology where work that is happening in an environment is brought into a chatroom. While the chatroom naturally allows for conversation about the work to happen like discussion of plans and ideas, ChatOps is about more than the conversation. It’s about taking the environment into the chatroom, too. So, a good ChatOps implementation might have notices pop up in chatrooms about changes in a server’s status…and it should have to some automated functionality so that someone might be able to reboot the server or start a backup process just by typing a command into the chatroom.</p> <p>This allows a team to have a high degree of communication about the working environment. When something happens to a server or application in production, the entire team (subscribed to the chatroom channel) becomes aware of it immediately and can start to have a conversation about what caused the problem and how to fix it. Furthermore, the chatroom becomes a shared console for the team. Each team member is aware when someone decides to do something like start a backup or change a DNS entry. Plus, new team members can quickly learn the ropes by just watching other team members exercise the tools…and have immediate conversation about them.</p> <p>This is ChatOps. Now, while the methodology is operational in nature, it doesn’t have to be limited to just the Ops realm. There are lots of ways to leverage the ChatOps thinking for developers. This can provide lots of value from helping to establish a DevOps culture to just simply increasing velocity of developers. Join us for a discussion of how developers can use ChatOps to help write better code more efficiently with few defect.</p> <p><b>Dev SIG Info:</b><br/>More information and communication may be found at the SIG's Google Group: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/agileaustin-dev""><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/agileaustin-dev"" class=""linkified"">http://groups.google.com/group/agileaustin-dev</a></a>.

"<p><b>Topic: Radical Roadmapping</b></p> <p>Radical Roadmapping - Creating Synchronized Agile Product and Technology Roadmaps</p> <p>This presentation will discuss why a company would create and maintain three major artifacts (innovation roadmap, infrastructure/platform roadmap, and operations/DevOps roadmap) as well as the process to do so. Further it will cover how to synchronize them in order to move away from making OR decisions to making AND decisions that will please all stakeholders. It will also discuss key cultural changes that must be present in order to achieve maximum benefit from this approach and challenges experienced along the way to making this a reality at Socialware, a SaaS product company. Finally, this will include real world examples of the evolution of these roadmaps over 18 months that participants can take away and use as guidelines for doing so.</p> <p>This concept is RADICAL as it is innovative in both its novel approach and ability to drive enormously positive organizational agility.</p> <p>Of course, in Matt's usual energetic* style, there will be tangents, humorous self-deprecating references of learning (aka failure), and time for participants to describe how this would ""never work"" in their organization coupled with Matt's re-framing to help them understand how it just might.</p> <p>*Best feedback comment ever received in his Keep Austin Agile 2015 presentation on Continuous Capacity Planning: ""Man, this guy has been drinking way too much coffee for a 4:00 PM presentation!""</p> <p><b>Speaker: Matt Roberts</b></p> <p>Matt Roberts is an agile pragmatist continuing his lifelong learning journey, currently serving customers and innovators throughout the complete value chain as VP of Product Engineering for Continuum Analytics.

"<p><b>Topic: Checking as a Service</b></p> <p>Further Location Update: we're now at Homeaway in the Domain for this meeting! We can resume at Planview from June.<br/>---</p> <p>Bret Pettichord has graciously agreed to give a preview of his Selenium Conference India 2016 Keynote. Below is a description of the talk (followed by an interactive discussion) that he will be giving.</p> <p>---</p> <p>This talk suggests a reframe in how we understand the business value of automated testing. One shift is to see automation as ""checking"" rather than ""testing"". Another is the shift from software delivery to service delivery, including fully embracing DevOps. The resulting approach could be called Checking as a Service or CheckOps, and forces us to rethink traditional automation priorities. In this talk, Bret will explain how change in approach has affected teams he's worked with and how you can use it to improve your ability to deliver valued services.</p> <p><b>Speaker: Bret Pettichord</b></p> <p>Bret Pettichord is an author of Lessons Learned in Software Testing, a founder of the Watir project and member of the launch team for Selenium 1.0.

"<p><b>Topic: The Underbelly of DevOps</b></p> <p>Beneath all kinds of cool, shiny, and awesome stuff is an infrastructure and set of underpinnings that make the shiny possible.

Just because we use the capacity in new and exciting ways does not mean that we are out of the business of capacity planning, cost management, etc. In fact, the whole point of Agile and DevOps is to produce more business value with greater efficiency.

"<p><b>Topic: Identifying Useful Metrics</b></p> <p>Which metrics are truly useful for QA as well as for non-QA folks? What is a good place to start capturing metrics? How do metrics evolve over time?</p> <p><b>Speaker: Kate Conway</b></p> <p>Kate Conway has always asked a lot of questions. During her 6 years of Unix/Linux System Administration roles, those questions were mainly about OS, backups, networking and who unplugged that power cable. Eventually, those answers steered Kate's career into Software QA where she has been able to ask more exciting questions over the last 6 years as a test engineer and manager. There was even a brief 2 year period in Product/Project Management with a mostly different set of questions, but those answers looped back into QA.</p> <p><b>QA SIG North Info:</b><br/>More information and communication may be found at the SIG's Google Group: <a href=""http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agileaustinqasig/""><a href=""http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agileaustinqasig/"" class=""linkified"">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agileaustinqasig/</a></a>.

"<p><b>Topic: What is the future of SLAs in the DevOps world?</b></p> <p>**********NOTE NEW VENUE DURING CONSTRUCTION************</p> <p>The SLA is a classic mechanism for measuring how services are provided / consumed. It is usually a part of a relatively transactional structure. Even inside the same company, the notion is still a customer/vendor type relationship where each is incented to 'get the most bang for the buck'. Which on the consumer side means demand more and on the provider side means keep costs low per customer. The SLA basically dictates the minimum / least common denominator target in that business relationship.</p> <p>That setup may be great for keeping costs down and mediocrity up, but it can play hell with collaboration and really be a major source of 'us v. them' conflicts. And that's where DevOps comes in. Collaborative culture is much less likely to thrive in a typical setup, but the business still needs to know how well things are going. This month we are going to discuss how this is being handled today and ideas for how to handle it in the future.</p> <p>We will do a Lean Coffee discussion, so come prepared to discuss:</p> <p>* What role SLAs have in a DevOps world<br/>* If not an SLA to manage goal achievement, then what?<br/>* If you are stuck in a classic IT 'shared service' environment, how do you get around structures like this?<br/>* Other classic metrics that are problematic in DevOps<br/>* Other topic-related items you think are important</p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>Dan</p> <p>**********NOTE NEW VENUE DURING CONSTRUCTION************</p> <p><b>Speaker: Lean Coffee</b></p> <p>Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting.

"<p><b>Topic: Welcome to the Matrix! Org Structure In Agile</b></p> <p>Traditional organizations assign differing degrees of control to certain roles, a key role being manager. Senior Director of Coaching and Training Doc List has seen cross-functional teams comprising devs, UX, QA and other roles reporting to the dev manager, UX manager, QA manager or some other type of manager, respectively. The result is chaos and confusion due to competing priorities and power plays. Often a manager is assigned to the ScrumMaster or Product Owner role. In the event of a conflict of interest, team members are forced to ask themselves which role the manager-SM is filling. This is an abbreviated version of Doc’s session at KAA2016, which aims to shed some light on this problem and explore possible alternatives that better support Agile structures.</p> <p><b>Speaker: Doc List</b></p> <p>Doc List has spent much of his thirty-five years in the software development community in leadership and coaching roles. Doc’s education in clinical and industrial/organizational psychology has contributed to his understanding of language and interaction between people. Roles as agile coach, facilitator, and trainer have brought the importance of language and interaction into finer focus, as has his blog at doclist.me. Doc's experience as a leader, trainer, coach, presenter, facilitator, and professional speaker blends into an unusual appreciation for and mastery of the subtlety of spoken and written language, as well as the power of human interaction in various forms.</p> <p><b>Agile Leaders SIG Info:</b><br/>More information and communication may be found at the SIG's Google Group: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/agile-austin-leaders""><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/agile-austin-leaders"" class=""linkified"">http://groups.google.com/group/agile-austin-leaders</a></a>.

"<p><b>Topic: Portfolio Management and DevOps</b></p> <p><br/>**********NOTE NEW VENUE DURING CONSTRUCTION************</p> <p>A classic problem associated with with software and in general is how do you manage the portfolio of stuff you have.<br/>That can be about Applications, Tools, Infrastructure components, etc., but it all adds up to understanding what is valuable enough to keep - or not.<br/>With DevOps practices, there are a couple of dimensions that come to mind immediately.<br/>First, of course, is the portfolio of DevOps tools itself - there are a lot of them, so it is easy to over-commit.<br/>Second, however, is tha notion that DevOps can be a game changer for the value of an application in the portfolio. For example, a dog of an app that everyone hates could be a 'diamond in the rough' that is polished by the ability to more rapidly enhance its functionality. General 'Agility' is a frequent reason cited by business leaders for adopting Agile &amp; DevOps practices, so tracking that kind of impact to the Application portfolio is very important.</p> <p>We will do a Lean Coffee discussion, so come prepared to discuss:</p> <p>* How do you manage your DevOps tool portfolio?<br/>* When do applications just not warrant automation (e.g. costs more to add automation than just leaving it alone)?<br/>* Once you apply DevOps practices to an application, how does its position in the portfolio change? (e.g. cheaper to maintain, now adds features faster &amp; is more valuable, etc.)<br/>* How do you measure the Application portfolio impact of DevOps?<br/>* Other topic-related items you think are important!</p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>Dan</p> <p>**********NOTE NEW VENUE DURING CONSTRUCTION************</p> <p><b>Speaker: Lean Coffee</b></p> <p>Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting.

"<p><b>Topic: Remember when you were green to IT / Agile?</b></p> <p>Remember what it was like when you first hit the market and were getting your first job as a developer or QA engineer or analyst? Some of us do, some don't. Join us today as we have a couple of interns join the conversation to share what they've learned in their internships so far. We can hear about their experiences and their expectations for their career. Think about all of those things that you know now that you wish someone told you back then about IT/Agile. This is your chance to help shape the future of our industry and share those thoughts with some young, eager minds ready to rule the world some day. While this is a great chance to pass on your wisdom, there are some learning opportunities for all of us as leaders as we hear what newcomers think of IT/Agile. Let's listen to these young college students and hear about what their generation is expecting out of our industry.

"<p><b>Topic: Innovation Games for Agile Ceremonies</b></p> <p>

Innovation Games are set of activities created by Luke Hohmann as a means of generating targeted feedback about a product or service. These games provide data such as what customer needs are or can help prioritize a product feature roadmap. While Agile methodologies can help us write software right, Innovation Games can help us write the right software. But, how powerful would it be to combine those powers? This presentation will describe Innovation Games and discuss some of the games that can be repurposed to help facilitate and enhance things in our day-to-day Agile development.</p> <p>

"<p><b>Topic: The Cross-Team challenges of Scale</b></p> <p>The Cross-Team challenges of Scale: Communication, Visibility, and Orchestration</p> <p>Enterprise scale surfaces organizational and tooling problems beyond the token agility challenges. Full-stack teams are rare and siloed efforts fail to synchronize. Variations span technical stacks, lifecycle approaches, product/customer foci, and development philosophies. Enterprise teams struggle to share value streams, tools, metrics, or even priorities. Shared service teams are common and often have only distant alignment with customers... teams cannot complete features because they are held hostage by other work.</p> <p>Getting true convergence and visibility would help. But the scrum of scrums approach has not really addressed things, and the different scaling frameworks have not yet saved us. The tools don't really fit the problems well either. Ultimately large organizations usually share an over-arching challenge - momentum. Superficial changes are easy... real change to culture and execution not so much. Do we really know how to do it yet?</p> <p>This presentation is to frame and invite discussion around scaling with disparate teams, and getting ahead of our challenges with dependencies, shared vision and priorities, and orchestration - so that we see the rocks and avoid them. My guess is that we have already crashed against them once or twice. Do bring all of your great questions, techniques, and experiences.</p> <p><b>Speaker: Jeff Smith</b></p> <p>Jeff Smith has over 30 years in high-tech, starting in electronic design for image processing and defense, moving then into software development and tooling, finally settling into a team performance focus, guiding software teams in lean and agile practices, organizational change, and technical methods.</p> <p>His past work includes companies large and small across industries, including Dell, IBM, Home Depot, Boeing, Lexis-Nexis, MDProductivity, BearingPoint, NetObjectives, Trilogy, Recognition Equipment, Mizar, LTV Aerospace &amp; Defense, Amdahl, and others.

Even equipped with the best possible data, a growing body of research reveals just how deeply flawed our perceptions, thinking, and conclusions are and why. Be careful not to assume that agile methods alone are the solution.</p> <p>

What is the Solution? Awareness! By exploring the psychology of error we create the opportunity to overcome many of the pitfalls hindering even the best teams. We reveal a common condition that lowers individual IQ by 13 points! We show why many teams perform far below the level they think they are. We explore the biases, fallacies, and mental pratfalls common to every one of us rendering even the smartest teams dumb. You’ll come away with an understanding of the very real forces that distort our decisions and concrete tips you can use to mitigate the damage, and avoid these traps altogether.</p> <p>

"<p><b>Topic: Quality in an Agile world: key considerations for </b></p> <p>The field of IT is always changing, with new tools, technologies, paradigms, patterns and programming languages to introduce dynamic or more efficient ways of getting solutions into the hands of our stakeholders. Yet, the problems that Agile are trying to solve are not new. While the field is transformed practically every day, the fundamental process to successfully take innovative ideas to implementation remains the same: we have a strategic vision, we document that vision into goals, imperatives, and measures. We define requirements, design, build, and test code, which we deploy, train on and support.</p> <p>So, why does quality delivery continue to be so challenging for so many organizations? In this discussion we aim to answer the following questions: what problems are organizations trying to solve through Agile? What are the barriers that typically hinder Agile adoption? Where do large, complex organizations start as they embark on an Agile transformation?</p> <p><b>Speaker: Jon Tolmach and Dalton Huguley</b></p> <p>Jon Tolmach:<br/>Jon runs the Strategy &amp; Architecture practice for Randstad Technologies where he helps CIOs and IT organizations to be more effective business partners and to operate more efficiently.

Scrum has become the de-facto standard for Agile team delivery. And with the success of Scrum organizations are now looking to employ Agile at Scale. Scaling means different things to different people, but broadly can be described as either growing the number of people delivering software in an agile way (agile product delivery) or growing the use of agile in ancillary parts of software delivery supply chain. In this talk we focus on how Nexus, an exoskeleton for Scrum can help scale your Agile product delivery.

DevOps brings both opportunities and challenges to improving the overall security of an application or environment. There has been a groundswell of interest in how DevOps and Security work together over the last year and the LASCON security conference will have just happened.</p> <p>This month, we are going to do a themed Lean Coffee style discussion on the security ramifications of DevOps. Please come ready to share your questions, ideas, and learnings!</p> <p>*Where does DevOps help/hinder security practices?<br/>*What new security practices do you need to keep up with DevOps?<br/>*How are you keeping security up to the pace of DevOps?<br/>*How are you getting the various roles on your team to focus on DevOps?<br/>*Other theme-related items you think are important - it's Lean Coffee, so bring all your ideas (but please keep to the theme)!</p> <p>Hope you can make it out!</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>Dan</p> <p><b>Speaker: LeanCoffee</b></p> <p>Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting.

"<p><b>Topic: If You Build It, Will They Use It?</b></p> <p>If You Build It, Will They Use It? Leveraging Business Objectives to Deliver Successful Projects</p> <p>Business Objectives are the measurable results a business desires to achieve when executing a project. They can be used to ensure that everything developed in the project contributes to the desired measurable business value. This discussion will help Product Owners and Business Analysts learn to develop good business objectives, to derive user stories from them, and how to apply them to control project or product scope.</p> <p><b>Speaker: Candase Hokanson</b></p> <p>Candase is a Senior Product Manager at Seilevel and a PMI-Agile Certified Practitioner who trains and coaches product owners, scrum masters and business analysts on agile approaches as well as championing products in those roles for clients.

With a wide variety of needs in the modern business world, Dan Frey and eStaff LLC offers several different methods to fill the empty positions of tech comapnies while helping programmers skip the resume process and get straight to the interview!</p> <p>Their four methods are:</p> <p>• Direct Placement - For this program, they find candidates who can join  tech companies immediately. Typically, the tech client is responsible for paying eStaff LLC so unlike other staffing agencies they do not then take from the new hire's  salary! This option is perfect for companies looking to fill a long-term position immediately and thus skip the resume process.</p> <p>• Contract to Hire - This program is for the employers who want to test out candidates before hiring them. This lets you try out a potential candidate for a period of time to see if they fit well with your company. Payment for this plan is usually in the form of a bill rate of 1.4 times the hourly pay of the candidate. Contract terms are usually three or six months in length, depending on the type of position offered.</p> <p>• Contract - This allows you to bring in personnel for a specific period of time. This is particularly helpful for short-term projects or initiatives where a certain expertise is needed. Maybe you just need some extra help. This is perfect for you. Payment for this plan is usually 1.4 times the hourly rate of the personnel brought in to augment the staff. These candidates may be hired directly following the completion of the contract.</p> <p>• Payrolling - Do you have a potential hire that could use some experience before being brought on staff? This option is for you. Have them temporarily join the eStaff LLC team. Find out what kind of worker they are. Our staffing agency will communicate with you and help you to decide whether to hire the employee. This option is a low risk, high reward type of scenario.</p> <p>Whether you’re looking to hire immediately or take time to evaluate some candidates, the strategic staffing agency here will help you to fill your employment needs nationwide including Austin and the surrounding areas. Do you need more information on one of the opportunities mentioned above?</p> <p>Then come join us for this open forum where you get to ask what Dan believes are the hot programming languages companies ill be hiring for up to five years from now based on what they know works from years of helping programmers skip the resume and get straight to the job and getting paid!</p> <p><br/>LIMITED 20 person SEATING!

Typically, the tech client is responsible for paying eStaff LLC so unlike other staffing agencies they do not then take from the new hire's  salary! This  is perfect for companies looking to fill a long-term position immediately and thus skip the resume process.</p> <p>• Contract to Hire - This program is for the employers who want to test out candidates before hiring them. This lets them try out a potential candidate for a period of time to see if they fit well with their company and the programmer / developer.</p> <p>• Contract Basis - This allows Estaff to help people like you get a personnel job for a specific period of time. This is particularly helpful for short-term projects or initiatives where a certain expertise is needed. Maybe you just need some extra help getting student debt caught up part time while building up your expertise for the next big career change? ;)</p> <p>• Payrolling - Helps companies take on potential hire that could use some experience before being brought on staff, aka entry level! This option is a low risk, high reward type of scenario.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Come join us for this open forum where you get to ask what Dan believes are the hot programming languages companies ill be hiring for up to five years from now based on what they know works from years of helping programmers skip the resume and get straight to the job and getting paid!</p> <p>LIMITED 25 person SEATING!

Typically, the tech client is responsible for paying eStaff LLC so unlike other staffing agencies they do not then take from the new hire's  salary! This  is perfect for companies looking to fill a long-term position immediately and thus skip the resume process.</p> <p>• Contract to Hire - This program is for the employers who want to test out candidates before hiring them. This lets them try out a potential candidate for a period of time to see if they fit well with their company and the programmer / developer.</p> <p>• Contract Basis - This allows Estaff to help people like you get a personnel job for a specific period of time. This is particularly helpful for short-term projects or initiatives where a certain expertise is needed. Maybe you just need some extra help getting student debt caught up part time while building up your expertise for the next big career change? ;)</p> <p>• Payrolling - Helps companies take on potential hire that could use some experience before being brought on staff, aka entry level! This option is a low risk, high reward type of scenario.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Come join us for this open forum where you get to ask what Dan believes are the hot programming languages companies ill be hiring for up to five years from now based on what they know works from years of helping programmers skip the resume and get straight to the job and getting paid!</p> <p>LIMITED 25 person SEATING!

"<p>NOTE: Time &amp; Place are not the norm!</p> <p>We were literally a day early for Chef to roll out the new Habitat tooling for orchestration this month!</p> <p>Never fear however because some of our most excellent community members at Home Away have organized a demo! Here are the details:</p> <p><b>Abstract:<br/></b></p> <p>Matt Ray is the Director of Partner Integration for the open source systems automation platform and company Chef. He is active in several open source communities, worked in a wide variety of industries and has several degrees from the University of Texas at Austin. He has been a contributor to the open source community for nearly two decades and has spoken at and organized many conferences. He currently resides in Austin, Texas but will be relocating to Sydney, Australia soon. He podcasts at SoftwareDefinedTalk.com, blogs at LeastResistance.net and is @mattray on Twitter, IRC and GitHub.</p> <p><b>Bio:<br/></b></p> <p>Habitat (<a href=""https://habitat.sh"" class=""linkified"">https://habitat.sh</a>) is a new open source project from Chef Software focused on the automation of applications. Habitat centers application configuration, management, and behavior around the application itself, not the infrastructure that the app runs on. This allows Habitat to be deployed and run on various infrastructure environments, such as bare metal, VM, containers, and PaaS. Habitat is comprised of plan and build system, a supervisor, an HTTP interface on that supervisor to report package status, a depot, a communication model for disseminating rumors through a supervisor ring, and many other components. Habitat is complementary to Mesos because it manages the lifecycle of applications within the containers while Mesos manages everything outside the container (managing compute, network, scheduling, etc.). This session will provide an introduction to Habitat and discuss the current state of the Mesos and Habitat integration.</p> <p>Many thanks to Praveen and Matt for whipping up some extra awesome.</p>",Austin DevOps,BONUS: Application Automation with Chef Habitat,1467243000000

"<p><b>Mini-conference format (keynote + 3 35 minute discussion blocks planned in open-spaces style).</b></p> <p>In larger companies, DevOps is often seen in the same light as Agile. While efforts are made to transition to some perceived ""better way,"" substantive change is fleeting.  </p> <p>Let's talk about how DevOps transitions become more difficult as organization grow. So questions to seed the discussion:</p> <p>• What does DevOps look like in a larger shop where managers exist?  </p> <p>• What are some of risks a manager might concern themselves with that are not obvious to the engineers making the magic DevOps elixir? </p> <p>• How can I (a manager) understand both the risk and the probability of the risk so I can make informed decisions?</p> <p>• Does DevOps mean I must also be Agile?</p> <p>• Should I (a manager) attempt to cause cultural change, or should I try to enable grassroots initiative?</p> <p>• What is the right pace for change? How do I measure this so that I don't choke my organization with too many good ideas?</p> <p>• How do I hire for DevOps?</p> <p>Boyd Hemphill will do a 10 minute presentation on what DevOps is then we will get down to discussion groups around 3 to 5 basic themes.  </p> <p><i><b>This effort will kick off a new sub-group of the Austin DevOps Meetup: DevOps for Managers.  Please invite your manager to attend so they can help to form the group around their needs.</b></i></p>",Austin DevOps,DevOps for Manager Types,1468278000000

"<p><b>The set up:</b></p> <p>Both Docker and Packer leverage the idea of building and deploying an image (rather than code) as the production artifact. This, in itself, is a significant departure from how many accomplish launch and release of systems today.</p> <p>Docker is a way to package an application to deliver it across multiple and varied operating systems.  The catch is that it uses containers as its virtualization instrument. <br/>Packer, by Hashicorp, is a tool that allows one to package an application in a similar way using the more familiar virtual machine as its virtualization instrument.</p> <p><b>The format:</b></p> <p>A short introduction to the ideas behind golden images, bakeries and immutable deploys will be given.

The <b>OpenStack-Ansible project</b> allows deployers to overcome these challenges using tools that they already know.  The project is packed full of well-tested, opinionated defaults that can be reconfigured easily.  It's the backbone of Rackspace's Private Cloud product and it's the deployment mechanism for the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC) Cluster.</p> <p><br/>In this talk, <b>Major Hayden</b> will lead the audience through an overview of OpenStack-Ansible and how to use it for small and large OpenStack clouds.  The audience will learn how to perform an all-in-one deployment for testing and how to prepare multiple physical servers for an OpenStack-Ansible deployment.</p> <p><b>Major Hayden</b> builds OpenStack clouds as a <b>Principal Architect at Rackspace</b>. His primary focus is on the OpenStack-Ansible project, but he also works on information security improvements for OpenStack deployments. He is a Red Hat Certified Architect and he has contributed to several open source projects, including dracut, systemd, and Ansible. Within the Fedora Linux community, Major serves on the Fedora Security Team and Fedora Server Working Group. Major enjoys writing on his personal blog, <b>major.io</b>, and he talks about technical topics on Twitter as <b>@majorhayden</b>.</p> <p><b>Reminders:</b> • <i><b>LOCATION</b></i> - <b>Rackspace Austin - 9001 North IH35 (east side frontage road) #150, Austin, TX 78753 </b></p> <p>• NOTE: Rackspace  security requires you provide a government issued ID in order to gain access to the facility. we recommend you arrive ~ 6:00 - 6:15pm.</p> <p>• There will be a <b>light dinner and soft drinks provided courtesy of Rackspace @</b>6:15pm - with networking time till about 6:45pm -<b> we will kick off the speaking sessions ~ 6:45pm.</b></p>",OpenStack Austin Texas,"June OpenStack Meetup - Flexible, simple deployments with OpenStack-Ansible",1466464500000

"<p>Let's meetup on OpenStack and enjoy an agenda free night of openstack discussion organized with the Lean Coffee format. <b>We are going to shake up the format for the Meetup  - NO POWERPOINT! </b></p> <p><br/>If you have never participated in a lean coffee session, don't fear! We will have organizers on site who can help facilitate your experience. Also it's rather low key and easy to master!</p> <p><br/>Officially ""Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting. Participants gather, build an agenda, and begin talking. Conversations are directed and productive because the agenda for the meeting was democratically generated.""</p> <p><br/>Unofficially its a group of people interested in asking questions or talking about a user-submitted topic. Attendees nominate topics or pose questions onto Post-It Notes. Attendees then pitch their topic or question to the group in a sentence or two to provide context</p> <p><br/>Members of the group cast three votes each on topics -- they can cast all three votes on one topic or spread them among topics they're interested in</p> <p><br/>Using a timer set for 5 minutes, the group talks about the topic. Once the timer is up, the group votes using thumbs up or down to determine whether to keep discussing. </p> <p><br/>If the up votes have it, the topic continues for another 2 minutes.  If the down votes have it, the topic moves to the next swim lane.</p> <p><br/>This is a great tool to allow for community-curated topics to gain attention while staying interesting thanks to the group-driven voting and time boxing! It's been used effectively by some other Meetups with great success. Some teams have even brought the format back to their offices to better facilitate team meetings and agile rituals.</p> <p><b>Our Sept session is brought to you by Dell Technologies and RackSpace.</b></p> <p><br/><b>Reminders:</b></p> <p>• <i><b>LOCATION</b></i> - <b>Rackspace Austin - 9001 North IH35 (east side frontage road) #150, Austin, TX 78753 </b></p> <p>• NOTE: Rackspace  security requires you provide a government issued ID in order to gain access to the facility. we recommend you arrive ~ 6:00 - 6:15pm.</p> <p>• There will be a <b>light dinner and soft drinks provided courtesy of Dell Technologies  @</b>6:15pm - with networking time till about 6:45pm -<b> we will kick off the speaking sessions ~ 6:45pm.</b></p>",OpenStack Austin Texas,OpenStack and Lean Coffee!!,1473981300000
"<p>Hello all - we have a compelling session this month - and <b>NOTE the day change</b> to <b>Monday Oct. 10.</b><b>Red Hat and RackSpace</b> are co-sponsoring this month.  </p> <p><br/>One of the ongoing challenges with any open source project, including OpenStack, is taking the project and making it an enterprise ready solution. In our session this month we will explore how Rackspace and Red Hat are collaborating to deliver a productized OpenStack Platform within a couple months of upstream GA without sacrificing testing while also ensuring a smooth in-place upgrade process.  We will discuss <b>lessons learned from upstream, to RDO,</b> to Red Hat to Rackspace,  and how <b>continuous integration testing</b> that goes beyond the border of any one project is the key to help ensure that we are catching and fixing the problems as early as possible after changes have been made in any projects.</p> <p>Our session will be led by <b>Nick Barcet and</b> Daniel Sheppard. Nick is currently Director of Product Management for OpenStack at Red Hat.  Nick joined Red Hat in June 2014, as part of the acquisition of eNovance, where he was VP of Products. Prior to that role, Nick was Ubuntu Server and Cloud Product manager at Canonical, where he participated in the definition and success of Ubuntu as a platform above and under the cloud.</p> <p><br/>Nick joined the OpenStack project since its first summit in Austin and founded the Ceilometer project, now known as OpenStack Telemetry, at the Folsom summit in April 2012, to handle centralised metering on OpenStack.  Nick was also a Director of the Board of the OpenStack Foundation in 2013. Nick has been involved in Free Software since 2000 working with Novell and Intel in various technical and management roles.</p> <p><br/>Daniel Sheppard is a seasoned product manager with a background in infrastructure and software. Daniel has worked with companies ranging from Fortune 500 to early stage startup and is aware of the unique challenges each of these environments face with adoption and operation of technology. He brings that background to his current role as a product manager for Rackspace's OpenStack Cloud team where he is responsible for the Private Cloud powered by Red Hat offer and has spent the past year working to understand the virtualization needs of enterprises. Daniel holds multiple certifications in project management and has his MBA from W.P. Carey School of Business.</p> <p><br/><b>Reminders:</b></p> <p>• <i><b>LOCATION</b></i> - <b>Rackspace Austin - 9001 North IH35 (east side frontage road) #150, Austin, TX 78753 </b></p> <p>• NOTE: Rackspace  security requires you provide a government issued ID in order to gain access to the facility. we recommend you arrive ~ 6:00 - 6:15pm.</p> <p>• There will be a <b>light dinner and soft drinks provided courtesy of Red Hat  @</b>6:15pm - with networking time till about 6:45pm -<b> we will kick off the speaking sessions ~ 6:45pm.</b></p>",OpenStack Austin Texas,OpenStack Meetup: From upstream to the customer: continuous delivery chain,1476141300000
"<p><b>Update: We have added a cool 2nd topic for our Nov. session. See below for more details.</b></p> <p><br/>In November we will explore <b>Kubernetes with a high-level introduction</b> into the fundamental concepts of <b>containerization technology</b> and basic features of Kubernetes, the open-source container orchestration platform. Our session is co-sponsored by <b>Mirantis</b>. We will briefly cover different aspects of using Docker and Kubernetes with OpenStack. We will discuss running containers in OpenStack, installing a Kubernetes cluster on top of OpenStack, as well as using and orchestrating an OpenStack containerized control plane.</p> <p>Our lead speaker is <b>Chris Caillouet </b>- a Senior Technical Instructor for <b>Mirantis </b>who is based out of San Antonio, Texas. Chris has worked with OpenStack since its inception and is a founding member of OpenStack and the community ecosystem.

Fresh Code</p> <p>We all start coding at the same time. This is done to keep things fair. No one is allowed to come in and build on top of previous projects. It’s cool to work on designs beforehand, digital mockups, open source frameworks, and anything else available to everyone, but keep things within fair limits.</p> <p>2. Code Review</p> <p>Winning teams will be subject to a code-review at some point following the event or immediately before winning. This is to ensure that all code used is in fact fresh.</p> <p>3. Ownership and IP</p> <p>Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our events and are free to do with it as they wish.</p> <p>4. Team Size</p> <p>Teams of up to 5 humans are allowed. You can also add 1 cyborg, Furby, drone, or Sphero.</p> <p>5. Submissions</p> <p>Each hackathon has its individual <a href=""http://hackathon.io/"">hackathon.io</a> page, which projects should be submitted on. Submissions take place after 24 hours of pure hacking.</p> <p>6. DEMO your Hack</p> <p>You must demo your hack in order to present. No slide-decks or Powerpoint will be allowed. Two minute presentation and one minute Q&amp;A from Judges.</p> <p>7. Have a damn good time!</p> <p><a href=""https://s.evbuc.com/https_proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FA8uVG8V.png&amp;sig=ADR2i7_ZlfhOr6VhCWBFAb6uSaXPG0AvgA"" class=""linkified"">https://s.evbuc.com/https_proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FA8uVG8V.png&amp;sig=ADR2i7_ZlfhOr6VhCWBFAb6uSaXPG0AvgA</a></p> <p>What should I build?</p> <p>Let your gut guide you! We usually like to see projects that are innovative, and have the potential to improve or influence people’s lives. Try to build a hack that people can use, enjoy, and potentially scale. Most importantly, have fun with it and try to finish on time. We know you can only do so much in 24 hours, so it’s ok if your project is not perfect (yet).</p> <p>Who can attend?</p> <p>Anyone and everyone! Our attendees typically consist of junior developers looking to improve their skills, senior developers looking to expand their horizons, designers of all skill-sets, and serious entrepreneurs that can add value to teams. Bring your idea and let’s go!</p> <p>Are there travel stipends?</p> <p>Unfortunately, we cannot provide travel stipends for our global series.</p> <p>How is the hackathon judged?</p> <p>Let’s be honest, y’all can do better than Powerpoints. Which is why we rock with live DEMOS only! No exceptions. To win an AngelHack hackathon, you will have to demo your product for at least 30 seconds, but don’t worry if your project is still not 100% perfected. Projects will be judged based on the following criteria:</p> <p>Impact: How impactful will this solution be for it’s target audience? Is it scalable?Creativity: How original is this solution?Design: How well designed is this solution, from front end through to UI/UX?Execution: How well executed is this solution from start to finish?</p> <p>Last thing. In this day and age of #selfies and #squad photos, it’s likely that photos and/or video will be taken at the event.

"<p><b>Topic: </b>Police Body Cameras: Technology, Policy, and Advocacy</p> <p><b>Guest: </b>Kathy Mitchell, Texas Electronic Privacy Coalition</p> <p><b>Summary: </b> Kathy will be discussing the privacy and data retention issues surrounding the coming widespread use of Police Body Cameras both in Austin and at large. Very soon, Austin police officers will be equipped with video cameras (body cams) that will always be on during encounters with the public. But the city has yet to finalize a policy around data collection, data privacy, data retention/expunction and public access. There is a strong interest in public access, especially for video related to misconduct or incidents in which a civilian is hurt or killed. There is also a strong interest in privacy for everyone who may be the subject of body camera video. This talk will walk through some of the options that are on the table for an APD body camera policy that encourages accountability while also protecting privacy. We will also discuss the process by which such a policy could be enacted, and what will happen if we enact no policy at all.</p> <p><b>Resources:</b></p> <p>• Legislation authorizing body cams and setting the legal framework for Texas: <a href=""http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/SB00158F.htm"">84(R) SB 158 - Enrolled version - Bill Text</a></p> <p>• <a href=""http://www.austintexas.gov/APDbodycam"">City of Austin APD Bodycam page</a></p> <p>• City of Austin body cam vendor <a href=""https://www.austintexas.gov/financeonline/vendor_connection/solicitation/solicitation_details.cfm?sid=110270"">RFP</a>.</p> <p>• <a href=""http://austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/APD_Policy_2015-2_Issued_5-1-2015-updated.pdf"">Current body cam policy</a> to be replaced by one that addresses key issues: (Go to policy 303 at page 125.)</p> <p>• <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/02/05/a-new-report-shows-the-limits-of-police-body-cameras/""><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/02/05/a-new-report-shows-the-limits-of-police-body-cameras/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/02/05/a-new-report-shows-the-limits-of-police-body-cameras/</a></a></p> <p>• <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/police-body-camera-policies-privacy-and-first-amendment-protections""><a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/police-body-camera-policies-privacy-and-first-amendment-protections"" class=""linkified"">https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/police-body-camera-policies-privacy-and-first-amendment-protections</a></a></p> <p>--------------------</p> <p>Open Austin hosts a monthly meet-up, to discuss local open government and civic technology issues.

"<p>Topic: Transportation &amp; Sensors</p> <p>Guest: Jen Duthie &amp; Itamar Gal, UT Center for Transportation Research</p> <p>Summary: </p> <p>The Austin Transportation Department (ATD) has deployed a variety of digital sensors in order to measure the performance of the Austin traffic network. Recently they have partnered with the U.T. Center for Transportation Research (CTR) in order to utilize this data to inform decision making and guide planning. An important goal for this joint effort is to make as much of this data publicly available as possible and to promote involvement of the community. </p> <p>This talk will cover:</p> <p> * Which digital sensors are currently deployed </p> <p>* What kind of data are being collected </p> <p>* Examples of how sensor data has been used recently by ATD </p> <p>* Plans for utilizing and publishing data in the near future </p> <p>We are also interested in hearing from the civic hacking community. What kinds of data would you like to have access to? What kinds of civic hacking projects could be done in the transportation domain and how could we help support those efforts? Come and let us know!</p> <p>

"<p><b>Topic: data.world - Enriching Your Analysis with Census Data</b></p> <p><b>Summary</b>: </p> <p>Austin data startup <a href=""https://data.world/"">data.world</a> recently launched its data sharing &amp; collaboration platform and is currently in preview release mode. This summer, data.world partnered with the US Census Bureau to ingest the <a href=""http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html"">American Community Survey</a> in a Linked Data format to help data users enrich analyses that require US demographic information. An important goal for this joint effort is to empower more data users to utilize this fundamental source of information.</p> <p><br/>This talk will cover:</p> <p>* Overview of the ACS data available on data.world</p> <p>* Demo of the platform and data query tool </p> <p>* Tutorial on how to upload your own data sets and link to ACS data</p> <p>* How to contribute to and benefit from the network effect at the crossroads of Open Data and Linked Data</p> <p>* Where these powerful technologies are likely to take us next</p> <p><br/><b>About the Presenter:</b></p> <p>Jonathan Ortiz is a data scientist and knowledge engineer at Austin data startup <a href=""https://data.world/"">data.world</a>. This summer through a <a href=""http://renci.org/news/south-big-data-hub-links-talented-students-with-tech-startups-through-new-program/"">DataStart grant fellowship</a>, Jonathan worked with the US Census Bureau to make Census data more accessible and easier to combine with other data sets via data.world. Jonathan believes the census has much untapped potential and hopes his work galvanizes others to unlock innovative solutions to issues facing our country for years to come.Jonathan is one of six recipients of the 2016 DataStart grant fellowship managed by RENCI and the South Big Data Hub and supported by the National Science Foundation. Jonathan is a former student at the UT Data Analytics and Big Data Program. Prior to his work in data science, Jonathan accumulated extensive experience in media, marketing, and consulting. Most recently, Jonathan served as Director at Scratch, a division of Viacom that drives innovation by channeling the power of brands like MTV, BET, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon.  Jonathan received a Bachelor of Science in Economics with concentrations in Marketing and Management from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p> <p>

"<p>Happy Holidays from your local ACM Chapter!</p> <p>First, we want to apologize for the lack of organization on disseminating information regarding upcoming events. However, your patience has been well rewarded! Please read this announcement carefully. </p> <p>Note: If you have not provided information requested from the earlier communications, you will NOT receive free AWS Credits and gain access to Amazon's office environment! We have compiled a list of students who have responded, and we will be sending detailed instructions regarding pre-work that you will need to complete in preparation for the workshops. We will be using the instructions from this workshop as a spring-board for future machine learning lectures.</p> <p>For this machine learning workshop, we were fortunate enough to recruit some serious technical talent to help teach and demonstrate fundamental sections of this course! As a quick FYI, workshops like this can easily cost between hundreds to thousands of dollars in industry!</p> <p>Amazon has completely exceeded our humble expectations by issuing free credits on AWS to the students. Harris will provide an overview of the highly-capable AWS ecosystem. Tim and his solutions architect will instruct how to configure EC2 in preparation for a Hadoop Cluster Deployment.</p> <p>Cloudera has agreed to provide access to some of their senior talent. They will provide a high-level overview of Cloudera, Cloudera Manager and Cloudera Director. If you have ever worked in a Hadoop cluster, you can appreciate how Cloudera has helped simplify the Hadoop Ecosystem. Cloudera will be providing one of their senior leads that has worked extensively on Director. This should be very informative on understanding Director (and surrounding components) in detail!</p> <p>With the above said, the workshop's agenda is as follows:</p> <p>4 Sessions (1st Wednesday of the month):</p> <p>1st is January 6th: This session we will focus on AWS' EC2 and Cloudera Director. By the end of this session, you should be able to configure and deploy your own DEVELOPMENT Hadoop Cluster within EC2 using Director.</p> <p>2nd is February 3rd: This session will be a review of Session 1, and we will begin our first machine learning algorithm at scale. Roger will provide a more in-depth overview of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. This is extremely informative if you've ever tried to understand the menagerie of Apache projects and their functional use-cases. It's very easy to get overwhelmed!  Omar will instruct you in writing your first Map-Reduce Algorithm that is NOT WORD COUNT! </p> <p>3rd is March 2nd: Jaya, Omar, Roger, Misty, Chance and others will help introduce you to writing UDF's within Hive. We will also start looking at numerical recipes within Mahout and Spark.</p> <p>4th is April 6th: This will be a continuation of Spark, and we will conclude the workshop with a complete end-to-end walk through that ties it all together.</p> <p>Each session runs from 18:30 to ~ 20:45. We will provide detailed agendas before each session.</p>",Austin ACM SIGKDD - Austin's Big Data Machine Learning Group,Large Scale Machine Learning on Apache Hadoop Workshop,1452126600000

This is not just due to sexism and unconscious biases, but a lack of women applying and staying in technology roles.

After the kickoff event, the program continues with events that offer a fun, positive learning experience designed to build confidence, provide mentors and role models, and create a positive association with technology creation. Our program will cost nothing to the participants and we will be providing transportation, food, sign language interpreters, and childcare for those who need it.</p> <p>We accepted participant nominations through September 5 from area educators for students who maybe haven't participated in technology programs before, and who would benefit from exposure to hands-on activities, mentoring opportunities and career exposure.</p> <p>We received 339 nominations from 55 teachers in 37 different schools. A week after the nomination letters were delivered over 100 girls had registered. Of those girls, 31% are on lunch assistance, 47% call English their second language, and 88% do not identify as Caucasian.</p> <p>Teens Empower (<a href=""http://www.teensempower.com"" class=""linkified"">http://www.teensempower.com</a>) will be keynoting the first day of the kickoff event.
