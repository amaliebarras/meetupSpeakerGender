Presentations will be from 7pm-9pm, and afterwards we will go to one of the many great bars in the neighborhood.</p> <p><br/>We have 2 talks scheduled so far, and a 3rd to come:</p> <p><br/>Talk 1: Pet Portraits on a Meteor, by Will Sankey</p> <p><br/>Connecting people wanting portraits of their pets to aspiring artists was our goal -- MeteorJS was our means. This talk will explore how we went about creating e-commerce platform www.PetPortrait.Club using MeteorJS. It will outline the packages we used and the joys (and pitfalls) of working with Meteor. Healthcare professional and developer hobbyist Will Sankey uses Javascript and Python to explore data and create value. You can find more about him at</p> <p><a href=""http://www.willsankey.com/"">www.WillSankey.com</a></p> <p>.</p> <p><br/>Talk 2: Javascript is a Burrito Cart, by Mike Atkins</p> <p><br/>In this talk, we'll explore Javascript's concurrency model and explore some scenarios in which this model helps us and some scenarios where this model hurts us. Mike has been writing Javascript since 2011. In that time he's written several npm packages (some of which are used), the most important of which, edgar-facts, will teach you about his dog.</p> <p><br/>Talk 3: TBA</p> <p><br/>NationJS is close to sold out, but you can snag one of the remaining tickets with this promo code for a discount!</p> <p><br/><a href=""https://nationjs2015.eventbrite.com/?discount=js2015dcjs""><a href=""https://nationjs2015.eventbrite.com/?discount=js2015dcjs"" class=""linkified"">https://nationjs2015.eventbrite.com/?discount=js2015dcjs</a></a></p> <p><br/>The location is iStrategyLabs, 641 S St, NW, Floor 1, Washington, DC.

3,"<p>Often times, we hit a wall and get stuck on a problem, only to realize much later - and after lengthy and unnecessary pain- that the solution was simple if we had just reframed the problem as something else. Thinking like a Computer Scientist involves being able to take a step back, abstracting what we know about a problem space, and realizing relations to other, solved, problems that were not, and come away with that ""aha!"" moment that we all know and love immediately apparent.

14,"<p>Hi, everyone.  I’m excited to announce an incredible line-up of three awesome presenters and talks for the Nov 5th event hosted by Capital One.  Agenda is also below.  See you there! </p> <p><b>AGENDA</b></p> <p>6:00 – 6:30  Networking and food</p> <p>6:30 – 6:40  Welcome &amp; Introductions</p> <p>6:45 – 7:15   Capital One:  Spark and Auto Scaling</p> <p>7:20 – 7:50  Cloudera:  Kudu: a new storage engine for fast analytics on fast data</p> <p>7:55 – 8:25  Databricks: A Sneak Peek into Apache Spark 1.6</p> <p>8:30 – 8:45  Close &amp; Wrap-up   </p> <p><b>CAPITAL ONE: Spark and Auto Scaling </b></p> <p>For the upcoming Spark meetup on Nov 5th, Capital One will be showcasing its adoption of Spark by deep diving into its Spark cluster setup on AWS using CloudFormation and Chef. The session will focus on walking through the scripts that launch a 4 node cluster on AWS, deep dive into Auto Scaling capability of the cluster and auto creation &amp; deletion of the stack. This will be an interactive session that will include a demo of these capabilities, an opportunity to share learnings/feedback and ask questions!</p> <p><i>Presenter Bio: Saurabh Gupte</i></p> <p>Saurabh Gupte is a Software Engineer at Capital One and Spark Certified Developer. He is currently working on the team that is standing up a Spark platform for processing data at rest. Saurabh has over 10 years of experience in architecting, designing &amp; developing ETL and data movement applications.</p> <p><b>CLOUDERA: Kudu: a new storage engine for fast analytics on fast data</b></p> <p>Over the past several years, the Hadoop ecosystem has made great strides in its real-time access capabilities, narrowing the gap compared to traditional database technologies. With systems such as Impala and Apache Spark, analysts can now run complex queries or jobs over large datasets within a matter of seconds. With systems such as Apache HBase and Apache Phoenix, applications can achieve millisecond-scale random access to arbitrarily-sized datasets.</p> <p>Despite these advances, some important gaps remain that prevent many applications from transitioning to Hadoop-based architectures. Users are often caught between a rock and a hard place: columnar formats such as Apache Parquet offer extremely fast scan rates for analytics, but little to no ability for real-time modification or row-by-row indexed access. Online systems such as HBase offer very fast random access, but scan rates that are too slow for large scale data warehousing workloads.</p> <p>This talk introduces Kudu, a new open source storage engine that fills the gap described above. It will also highlight its integration with Apache Spark and demo an end-to-end data ingestion pipeline that uses Kafka, Spark Streaming, and Kudu which will then be queried using Impala.</p> <p><i>Presenter Bio: Jean-Daniel Cryans</i></p> <p>Jean-Daniel Cryans is a Software Engineer at Cloudera currently working on the Kudu team, and an Apache HBase PMC member. Previous to Cloudera, he worked at StumbleUpon where he worked on HBase while maintaining its production deployment there.</p> <p><b>DATABRICKS: A Sneak Peek into Apache Spark 1.6</b></p> <p>Pat McDonough, Director of Client Solutions at Databricks, will provide a sneak peek into Apache Spark 1.6 - from RDD to DataFrames to Datasets.  Spark 1.6 will include (but not limited to) adaptive query execution [SPARK-9850], a type-safe API called Dataset on top of DataFrames that leverages all the work in Project Tungsten to have more robust and efficient execution (including memory management, code generation, and query optimization) [SPARK-9999], and unified memory management by consolidating cache and execution memory [SPARK-10000].  Come to this Washington DC Area Spark Interactive session to learn more and ask questions about Spark 1.6!</p> <p><i>Presenter Bio: Pat McDonough</i></p> <p>Pat McDonough is one of Databricks' first employees, focused on helping customers build their Spark-based applications and data pipelines. For the past two years, he's played an important role in helping the Spark project grow to the most active project in Big Data, working hand-in-hand with the impressive engineering team that continues to push exciting new technology in to the project, and finding great ways to use this technology in the real world.

But helping humans visualize real-time streams is just as important. Visualizing real-time data introduces new UX and usability challenges for any developer embedding analytics into applications, especially when the target end users are business users and not data scientists. Self-service, interactive, subsecond response time to ad hoc queries -- these are the new UX requirements for any enterprise visualizing real-time data. Streaming data also lends itself to new paradigms of interaction with the stream itself, like being able to pause, rewind and replay a stream. This talk is a case study in how and why Zoomdata built a ""Data DVR"" capability using Spark and SparkStreaming. Ruhollah Farchtchi, Chief Technologist &amp; VP of <a href=""http://www.zoomdata.com/"">Zoomdata</a> Labs will describe the required user experience, the overall architecture and the specific use of Spark and Spark Streaming. We will describe the design considerations that led us to choose Spark Streaming over alternatives like Storm. We will show how end users configure the real-time increment and a historical retention window without writing any code themselves. We will also show how pause, rewind, replay is implemented inSpark and how the solution supports both real-time and historical analysis in the same architecture. Attendees will walk away with knowledge of Spark Streaming and how users can interactively work with streaming data. They will develop familiarity with the challenges of a lambda architecture and providing a consistent analytic experience over streaming and historical data.""</p> <p><b> Leveraging Spark in a Hybrid OLTP/OLAP RDBMS</b></p> <p>In this talk, we will discuss how we use Spark as part of a hybrid RDBMS architecture that includes Hadoop and HBase. The optimizer evaluates each query and sends OLTP traffic (including CRUD queries) to HBase and OLAP traffic to Spark. We will focus on the challenges of handling the tradeoffs inherent in an integrated architecture that simultaneously handles real-time and batch traffic. Lessons learned include: - Embedding Spark into a RDBMS - Running Spark on Yarn and isolating OLTP traffic from OLAP traffic - Accelerating the generation of Spark RDDs from HBase - Customizing the Spark UI The lessons learned can also be applied to other hybrid systems, such as Lambda architectures.</p> <p><b>John Leach </b>is the CTO and Co-Founder of <a href=""http://www.splicemachine.com/"">Splice Machine</a>.

Many market-leading companies like Lenovo have recognized that knowing the high-level web and mobile statistics about their visitors is valuable but not actionable. The key to understanding the needs of customers and visitors and delivering personalized experiences is predictive behavioral analytics, which requires integrating clickstream and other enterprise data on a Hadoop/Spark cluster. The clickstream data as generated by the leading marketing cloud providers like Adobe, Google, and IBM are also varied and complex with over a 1000 configurable fields. However, the clickstream data has enough commonality across enterprises that deploying a configurable purpose-built predictive behavioral application like SYNTASA can deliver significantly better time-to-value and ROI compared to an in-house development effort. In this session we will describe 1) Lenovo’s build vs. buy decision and 2) What makes Spark the ideal platform for building an predictive behavioral analytics application like SYNTASA that can be deployed on in-house Hadoop Cluster.</p> <p><b>Agenda: </b>

<b>TALK 2</b></p> <p><b>Title: </b>Explore big data at speed of thought with Spark 2.0 and SnappyData</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b><br/>Data exploration often requires running aggregation/slice-dice queries on data sourced from disparate sources. You may want to identify distribution patterns, outliers, etc and aid the feature selection process as you train your predictive models. As you begin to understand your data, you want to ask ad-hoc questions expressed through your visualization tool (which typically translates to SQL queries), study the results and iteratively explore the data set through more queries. Unfortunately, even when data sets can be in-memory, large data set computations take time breaking the train of thought and increasing time to insight . We know Spark can be fast through its in-memory parallel processing. But, Spark 1.x isn’t quite there. Spark 2.0 promises to offer 10X better speed than its predecessor. Spark 2.0 ushers some impressive improvements to interactive query performance. We first explore these advances - compiling the query plan eliminating virtual function calls, and other improvements in the Catalyst engine. We compare the performance to other popular popular query processing engines by studying the spark query plans. We then go through SnappyData (an open source project that integrates Spark with a database that offers OLTP, OLAP and stream processing in a single cluster) where we use smarter data colocation and Synopses data (.e.g. Stratified sampling) to dramatically cut down on the memory requirements as well as the query latency. We explain the key concepts in summarizing data using structures like stratified sampling by walking through some examples in Apache Zeppelin notebooks (a open source visualization tool for spark) and demonstrate how we can explore massive data sets with just your laptop resources while achieving remarkable speeds. </p> <p>

These costs quickly multiply when the number of transcribers who have access to sensitive data, such as medical records, becomes limited. In this talk, we engage non-expert transcribers who are given minimal instructions to bootstrap an automatic speech recognition system. With transcription costs of only five dollars per hour of data, the transcribers have an error rate of 25%.

51,"<p>Join us on <b>Wednesday, May 25th, 2016</b> as we discuss Emerging Technology Solutions with Graphistry, Inc. We will also discuss scanning and enumeration tools and techniques. For those who would like to have additional hands-on time, we will have a mobile lab in place for you to practice techniques you are already familiar with.</p> <p>To protect all our connected devices and software, security teams must now “assume breach,” putting resources into response and recovery. This has required organizations to rethink their end-to-end data pipelines. The SIEM side has been successful in aggregating alerts from across vendors, but the visual analytics tier still largely derives from the dashboard tools of 30 years ago. Visual tools have not kept pace with the increase in data, so we have lost situational awareness.</p> <p>Graphistry has been scaling visual analytics by using GPU clusters. We will demonstrate previously impossible ways of understanding and exploring millions of security alerts. For example, we will show how Graphistry’s scaled-up network diagrams helped quickly understand and navigate hundreds of millions daily alerts. In another example, as an individual alert is a symptom of a greater attack, we will show how this enables us to quickly pivot and expand the context to diagnose what else happened before and after an alert, and thereby guide subsequent remediations. Finally, as part of security’s shift into the data era, we will showcase how Graphistry uses Jupyter/IPython Notebooks with Python and Spark to create shareable forensic analyses that combine code and interactive visualizations.</p> <p><b>Keynote Speakers:</b><br/>Leo Meyerovich &amp; Thibaud Hottelier, Graphistry, Inc</p> <p><b>Linkedin:</b><br/><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-meyerovich-09649219"" class=""linkified"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-meyerovich-09649219</a><br/><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaudhottelier"" class=""linkified"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaudhottelier</a></p> <p><br/><b>Twitter:</b><br/>@graphistry<br/>@lmeyerov</p> <p><b>Meetup Location: </b><br/>RiverHouse Party Room<br/>1111 Army Navy Dr.<br/>Arlington, VA 22202<br/>Google Map: <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/K1gkrZVXwCB2"" class=""linkified"">https://goo.gl/maps/K1gkrZVXwCB2</a></p> <p>This meetup will be held on the Basement level, personnel will be onsite to assist.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b><br/>6:00 - 6:15 Networking<br/>6:15 - 7:00 Presentation 1<br/>7:00 - 7:15 Networking<br/>7:15 - 8:00 Presentation 2<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Closing remarks, networking &amp; clean up</p> <p><b>Parking (Denison Parking):</b> Free parking is available at 850 Army Navy Dr., Arlington, VA 22202.<br/>Google Map: <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/bHAK4oU1tMu"" class=""linkified"">https://goo.gl/maps/bHAK4oU1tMu</a></p> <p><b>Meetup Sponsorship: </b>With nearly 3,000 members, our group is full of Information Security professionals enthusiastic about staying abreast to new trends and changes in the industry.

Compliance, business partner requirements and industry best practices mean assessments must be done. For people going through the process the first time, it can be painful. Applications can be knocked over, databases filled with test data and errors galore. Preparing for and having an understanding what to expect from a penetration test (“pentest”) can make your developers and operations folks lives much less stressful. We will also cover how to make the most of your time and money before and after the assessment. </p> <p>* Discussing why you would need a security assessment<br/>* What to prepare to get the most of your assessment<br/>* What to expect during the assessment<br/>* How to get the most from the consulting engagement, tricks of the trade, etc<br/>* Further resources to enhance your own internal assessment program </p> <p><b>Keynote Speaker(s):</b><br/><b>Mike McCabe </b>has worked as a consultant and executive, helping build a consulting practice where he lead many companies through assessments.

Your tests are too… but they shouldn't be!</p> <p>Years helping teams write better tests has taught me one thing: consistency is crucial. Inconsistent tests slow teams down, wasting time to understand how each test works. Deciding on conventions—even arbitrary ones—can prevent tremendous pain later.</p> <p>This talk will introduce a ready-to-fork Test Style Guide of carefully-considered rules and templates for Rubyists. You can customize it to fit your preferred tools, too. Soon, you'll be on your way to having more consistent tests that are much more fun to maintain!</p> <p>---</p> <p>Everything You Know About the GIL is Wrong<br/>When a Rubyist hears ""concurrency"" they usually Google Elixir, Go, or even Node.js. Turns out, Ruby can be great for concurrency! The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) does NOT prevent Ruby programs from performing concurrently. In this presentation we'll discuss the true meaning of concurrency, explore the inner-workings of the GIL, and gain a deeper understanding of how the GIL effects concurrent programs. Along the way we'll write a bunch of concurrent Ruby code, run it on multiple interpreters, and compare the results.</p> <p>----</p> <p>A Tale of Two Feature Flags<br/>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Feature flags are a quick win for development teams seeking a way to more rapidly release software but can create unexpected technical complexity.</p> <p>Join us for a comparison of the life-cycles of two seemingly similar feature flags. We'll discuss the challenges teams often face when implementing them, as well as strategies to avoid these issues and deliver software quickly and reliably.</p>",Tech Talk DC,RubyConf Lightning Talks,1453330800000

That not including any infrastructure, containerization, and additional operations work. The three end states for full-stack devs are trying to do everything themselves (resulting in poor quality across the board), working endlessly (ending in burnout), or compromising on overall control of everything and augmenting their skills with frameworks and tools. This talk discusses how to best come to terms with relinquishing control and finding good frameworks when it comes to frontend development.</p> <p>About Brian<br/>I'm a full-stack developer who adopted frontend development out of necessity. I normally work with a Java stack, though I've worked in many other languages as any developer will. Most of my experience is in rapid application development spanning from infrastructure to UI.

If there is time, we can deploy to the cloud, or even build a container and deploy it in that. </p> <p>I will be showing how to use Docker  for the .NET Core development environment, so we can build and run our apps there. This way, you'll get to try the ASP.NET Core development workflow with Docker.

94,"<p>We're excited to have <a href=""http://jcarbaugh.com/"">Jeremy Carbaugh</a> join us to talk about Django Channels, an exciting new addition to the Django ecosystem.</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>We're facing a new asynchronous age in web development. WebSockets are universally supported by browsers and provide fast, light-weight communication with the server. Unfortunately, Django is tied to a strict HTTP request/response model that doesn't play nicely with interactive communication with clients. Django Channels replaces the core of Django with a messaging system that handles both normal HTTP requests and bi-directional messages.  </p> <p>PyCon Guide was created to make it easy to browse PyCon sessions and add them to your personal calendar. We built it using WebSockets and Channels because what better time is there to go to production with new technology than when all of your professional peers are going to look at?</p> <p>Come learn about how we built PyCon Guide, how WebSockets work, and the Channels-based future of Django.</p> <p>

This talk will explore how we went about creating e-commerce platform www.PetPortrait.Club using MeteorJS. It will outline the packages we used and the joys (and pitfalls) of working with Meteor. Healthcare professional and developer hobbyist Will Sankey uses Javascript and Python to explore data and create value. You can find more about him at www.WillSankey.com.</p> <p><br/>Talk 2: <b>Javascript is a Burrito Cart</b>, by Mike Atkins</p> <p><br/>In this talk, we'll explore Javascript's concurrency model and explore some scenarios in which this model helps us and some scenarios where this model hurts us. Mike has been writing Javascript since 2011. In that time he's written several npm packages (some of which are used), the most important of which, edgar-facts, will teach you about his dog.</p> <p><br/>Talk 3: <b>Oboe.js, better JSON through streams, </b>by Juan Caicedo</p> <p>Working with large JSON documents in a web app can be slow and cumbersome. Don't let your UX or performance suffer, instead bring the event driven nature of Unix streams to your REST data transfer, using Oboe.js. Juan has been node-ing since NationJS last year. He's a full-stack dev at Fluencia, where we works on the biggest Spanish-English online dictionary. He finds refactoring therapeutic, playing  board games exhilerating, and he never grew out of climbing trees.</p> <p>

And like it or not, it's making big headway in the web industry with large organizations integrating it, or shifting entirely. In this talk we'll cover some of the nuances of Node.js development, starting with a discussion about what Node is at its core and some architecture and run-time basics. We'll chat about comparisons to PHP and some development gotchas. We'll end with some strategies for implementing a Node.js application along side your existing PHP code!</p> <p>Developers of all levels will come out of this session with useful information and how to approach the 800-pound gorilla that is Node.js with no fear.</p> <p><b>About our speaker:<br/></b></p> <p>Shortly after it arrived at his home in 1993, <b>Jordan Kasper</b> began disassembling his first computer - his mother was not happy. She breathed more easily when he moved from hardware into programming, starting with BASIC. Jordan's experience includes companies large and small, universities, and numerous OSS projects, working in many languages from C++ to PHP to JavaScript. He also participates in local user groups, barcamps, and hackathons. Jordan's primary mission for the last 10 years has been to evangelize technology of all sorts and share what he has learned to help others grow. He currently works as a Developer Evangelist for StrongLoop, a leader in Node.js API software from design to development to scaling and monitoring. In his down time he enjoys puzzles of all sorts and board games!</p> <p><br/><b>Schedule:</b></p> <p>6:30 - 7PM: Meet &amp; Greet</p> <p>7PM - 8PM: Presentation</p> <p>8PM - 8:30: Clean up</p> <p>8:30 - ?: Retire to a local establishment to continue the conversations!</p>",DC PHP Developer's Community,Main meeting: Node.js: the 800-pound Gorilla,1447284600000

But it doesn't have to be that way. In this talk, Joseph Nelson discusses how data science enables individuals, even those with little subject area expertise, to produce functioning recommendation engines. Upon an award from the French Embassy, he led a team that sought to use data science to build a functioning wine recommendation engine. He describes clustering, user segmentation, and modeling to provide accurate pairings. While the model is not currently in deployment, Joseph discusses how French culinary experts reacted to an unveiling of the demonstration.</p> <p> ====== SPEAKER ======</p> <p><br/>Joseph is currently an instructor for General Assembly’s Data Science Immersive in DC. He particularly enjoys model selection and validation techniques as well as natural language processing. He has also guest lectured as a part of the Master’s in Data Science program at George Washington University. Previously, he built data visualization dashboards and data pipelines as a part of Facebook’s Politics and Government team. Joseph is an advocate for using technology to improve social well-being, particularly in government. When he’s not modeling (data), he’s reading, running, or learning the tools to build his next side project.</p> <p>You can find him on Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/josephofiowa"" class=""linkified"">https://twitter.com/josephofiowa</a> and Github: github.com/josephofiowa</p> <p>-- TENTATIVE SCHEDULE --</p> <p>6:30-7:00 - Networking<br/>7:00-7:10 - Introductions<br/>7:10 - 8:10 - Talk<br/>&gt; 8:10- Socializing</p>",Data Education DC, Building a Wine Recommendation Engine (When You Don't Know Wine),1477607400000
169,"<p>We are very excited to have the DHS come to Data Innovation DC to offer a series of lightning talks including:</p> <p>



<b>Stephen Dennis</b></p> <p><b>Topic: DHS S&amp;T HSARPA Data Analytics Engine</b></p> <p>Many business processes can benefit from the leverage of corporate data sources to create efficiencies and improve missions and operations.  The DHS Data Analytics Engine examines cross cutting technologies for automating computational analytics across S&amp;T programs and the homeland security enterprise.  This lightening talk will provide an overview of the S&amp;T strategic goals, major program areas, and engine construct.</p> <p><b>Chuck Lewis</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Big Data Laboratory </b></p> <p>HSARPA DA-E maintains and operates a state-of-the-art data analytics laboratory to support mission-relevant evaluations of emerging technologies, rapid experimentation, and strategic R&amp;D efforts. The lab infrastructure complies with privacy authorities and maintains security accreditation, allowing DA-E to use operational data to help DHS identify enterprise data analytics architectures and solutions.  </p> <p><b>James Younger</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Big Data Security</b></p> <p>This talk will focus on the challenges surrounding securing Big Data systems.  Hear how traditional security models are adapted to areas of Big Data security, where new approaches are being used and how Big Data itself is being utilized to provide more efficient and effective security operations.</p> <p><b>Shane Cullen</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Big Data Analytics for DHS Components</b></p> <p>DHS S&amp;T is assisting agencies with the development and fielding of advanced analytic systems. This lightning talk will focus on the system architectures and management methodologies that have resulted in successful analytic deployments.</p> <p><b>Aaron Mannes</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Big Data and Terrorism Analytics: Finding Haystacks</b></p> <p>Big data is a powerful tool for counter-terror. The ability to combine and analyze a range of social, cyber, and physical data can be leveraged to find terrorists, predict attacks, and understand their networks. Big data can find broad trends – the haystacks. But it is not an all-purpose panacea. When big data tools are used to find needles they may find too many, raising a host of legal and privacy concerns.</p> <p><b>Alexandria Phounsavath </b></p> <p><b>Topic: Risk Assessment </b></p> <p>How can DHS use data to respond to risk?  The most familiar application of data analytics for risk assessment may be passenger screening at airports.  TSA screens approximately 1.8 million passengers a day at 448 airports.  Additionally, it prescreens 2 million passengers before they arrive at the airport.  This discussion focuses on specific efforts at DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) that will further enhance the use of data for risk-based screening in aviation.</p> <p><b>Chris Featherston</b></p> <p><b>Topic:  Alaska/Arctic Situational Awareness Project (A/ASAP) </b></p> <p>DHS has an interest in understanding national infrastructure assets and navigation issues in the Arctic region.  The By examining, correlating, and developing analytic predictive tools, it is purposed that DHS can identify trends and datasets that can be tracked, measured and provide a timetable for infrastructure and asset management, movement, or protection.  The overall objective for this topic area is developing a predictive analytic capability using observable and historical sensor modeling of climate change in Alaska Arctic areas.</p> <p><b>Linda Vasta</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Wearable Technologies’ Analytics</b></p> <p>In support of one of S&amp;T’s Visionary Goals: “Responder of the Future: Protected, Connected, and Fully Aware”, the Data Analytics Engine is exploring how data generated from sensors in wearable technologies can inform the first responder and emergency management community.  A key step in this process is obtaining “customer input” from this community.  The talk will briefly discuss the methodology and process that will be used to obtain this critical input. </p> <p><b>Daniel Marasco</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Smart Cities</b></p> <p>Availability of new digital devices and enhanced connectivity has caused a shift in the way we develop urban environments. “Smart” cities leverage new technologies to solve new and old urban issues. In the past, cities were developed with static infrastructure, rigid in their operation and expansion. Smart cities can use data from vast sensor networks to make decisions, rapidly adapting and optimizing urban infrastructure and systems for ever-changing conditions. Smart city sensors can improve energy efficiency, optimize the pedestrian and vehicle traffic, evaluate principles of urban planning, and provide situational awareness and guidance in emergencies. However, information and communication infrastructure must be intelligent, resilient and adaptable to maximize impact. With proper development, smart cities will be more sustainable, secure, and livable than their more traditional counterparts.</p>",Data Innovation DC,Department of Homeland Security and Data!,1447369200000

175,"<p>Two of our local data scientists (Benjamin Bengfort and Jenny Kim) have just published an O'Reilly book called <a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035275.do"">Data Analytics with Hadoop</a>!  Come celebrate the release of their book with us, meet the authors, and mingle with your fellow data community members.  </p> <p>We will be holding a drawing to give away free copies of the book and will also have print copies available that attendees can purchase at a discount.  </p> <p><br/>About the Book</p> <p>Ready to use statistical and machine-learning techniques across large data sets? This practical guide shows you why the Hadoop ecosystem is perfect for the job. Instead of deployment, operations, or software development usually associated with distributed computing, you’ll focus on particular analyses you can build, the data warehousing techniques that Hadoop provides, and higher order data workflows this framework can produce.</p> <p>Data scientists and analysts will learn how to perform a wide range of techniques, from writing MapReduce and Spark applications with Python to using advanced modeling and data management with Spark MLlib, Hive, and HBase. You’ll also learn about the analytical processes and data systems available to build and empower data products that can handle—and actually require—huge amounts of data.</p> <p>• Understand core concepts behind Hadoop and cluster computing</p> <p>• Use design patterns and parallel analytical algorithms to create distributed data analysis jobs</p> <p>• Learn about data management, mining, and warehousing in a distributed context using Apache Hive and HBase</p> <p>• Use Sqoop and Apache Flume to ingest data from relational databases</p> <p>• Program complex Hadoop and Spark applications with Apache Pig and Spark DataFrames</p> <p>• Perform machine learning techniques such as classification, clustering, and collaborative filtering with Spark’s MLlib</p> <p><br/>About the Authors</p> <p>Benjamin Bengfort is a Data Scientist who lives inside the beltway but ignores politics (the normal business of DC) favoring technology instead. He is currently working to finish his PhD at the University of Maryland where he studies machine learning and distributed computing. His lab does have robots (though this field of study is not one he favors) and, much to his chagrin, they seem to constantly arm said robots with knives and tools; presumably to pursue culinary accolades. Having seen a robot attempt to slice a tomato, Benjamin prefers his own adventures in the kitchen where he specializes in fusion French and Guyanese cuisine as well as BBQ of all types. A professional programmer by trade, a Data Scientist by vocation, Benjamin's writing pursues a diverse range of subjects from Natural Language Processing, to Data Science with Python to analytics with Hadoop and Spark.</p> <p>Jenny Kim is an experienced big data engineer who works in both commercial software efforts as well as in academia. She has significant experience in working with large scale data, machine learning, and Hadoop implementations in production and research environments. Jenny (with Benjamin Bengfort) previously built a large scale recommender system that used a web crawler to gather ontological information about apparel products and produce recommendations from transactions. Currently, she is working with the Hue team at Cloudera, to help build intuitive interfaces for analyzing big data with Hadoop. </p>",Data Innovation DC,Data Analytics with Hadoop Book Release Celebration,1474929000000

While working for the BBC his work included coverage, both short and long-form, of international politics, five U.S. Presidential elections, battlefield conflict, diplomacy, the United Nations and its agencies, as well as natural and human tragedies.</p> <p>In the 90s Mark made the intrepid voyage across the Atlantic via jet airplane to hold senior management positions with the BBC’s New York Bureau before transferring to US Public Radio, serving senior positions at WNYC in New York, where he built a stellar reporting team that won the Edward R. Murrow Award and the DuPont Columbia Award for investigative reporting.  After Mark left New York he became Programming Director WAMU in Washington, DC, in this position he brought podcasting, internet streaming, and digital content management to WAMU, expanding the station’s range and increasing the listing base dramatically.</p> <p>Mark is the founder and CEO of Birkdale Media, a boutique media and public relations firm; Birkdale specializes in media coaching, interview preparation, public relations for individuals and for corporations.</p> <p>Above all else, Mark is a champion for data and data visualization in the newsroom and on the air.  We conducted an interview with him and were really impressed by the passion he displayed for Data Viz – full text of the interview below:</p> <p><br/>1) What got you into data visualization and how do you think data visualization has enhanced your profession? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>TV and Video Graphics have become so much more sophisticated in the digital age that they can be designed much more quickly, easily, and contain much more useful information for viewers, helping producers to explain complex stories and issues, and put them into better context than ever before. The internet means blogs, news-sites, etc. can contain way more vital information and background than they did before - and many organizations are utilizing data to enhance their story-telling, provide background, history, and further detail. </p> <p>


2) You worked for the BBC, how do you think that working for an international news agency affected your views on data? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>In my day (80's and 90's) a sophisticated graphic could take days, even weeks to assemble to be inserted into a news report. New technology speeds this process meaning producers can make much better use of graphics on video and on the web. </p> <p>


3) How do you see data visualization shaping the future of news media or vice versa how do you see news media shaping the path of data visualization? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>It opens up vast new possibilities for journalism. Better analysis, better explanations and details in investigative work (being able to collate and display complex documents, and show how they relate to each other, for instance). The news media in turn can drive the quest for big data using the Freedom of Information legislation on complex stories and issues and making it public utilizing graphics and big data. </p> <p>


4) How do we make the news - print, media, digital, etc.- Great Again? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>By using our imagination about how to tell stories and raise important issues in a more captivating and compelling way, rather than feeding the public cheap consumer-driven news which is often second or third hand. </p> <p>


5) What international news story from the past decade could have had a different outcome if data visualization was better used in covering it? </p> <p><b>Mark: </b>Resolution from any conflict zone you care to mention - by using big data to report it more accurately (Iraq, for example) thus raising public awareness. </p> <p><br/><b>Sponsor Announcements: </b></p> <p><img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/2/4/600_453868196.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/6/0/0/600_452550208.jpeg"" /></p> <p><img src=""http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/f/e/600_452550206.jpeg"" /></p>",Data Visualization DC,Success & Sanity in Data Journalism,1475015400000

A sentiment analysis algorithm is considered ‘table stakes’ for any serious text analytics platform in social media, finance, or security. As an example of supervised machine learning, I’ll show how these systems are trained. But I'll also show that they have the unavoidable property that they are better at spotting unsubtle expressions of extreme emotion. Such crude expressions are used by a particularly privileged group of authors: men. In this way, brands that depend on sentiment analysis to 'learn what people think' inevitably pay more attention to men. But the problem doesn't stop with sentiment analysis: at every step of any model building process, we make choices that can introduce bias, enhance privilege, or break the law!

This talk will present a novel information exposure detection framework that generates and analyzes the web footprints users leave across the social web. Our approach uses probabilistic operators, free text attribute extraction, and a population-based inference engine to generate the web footprints. Using a web footprint, the framework then quantifies a user’s level of information exposure relative to others and makes suggestions on which attributes to remove or hide.  After presenting the framework, I will show an evaluation that quantifies information exposure on  public profiles from Google+, LinkedIn, FourSquare, and Twitter. Finally, the talk will conclude with a brief discussion about data privacy and ethics.</p> <p>Dr. <a href=""http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~singh/"">Lisa Singh</a> is the Graduate Director and an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University. Her research interests are in data science, data mining, and databases.

189,"<p>For our first Data Science DC Meetup of 2016, we will be delving into how to scale up unsupervised learning -- the process of finding structure and groups in unlabeled data. Typical off-the-shelf clustering algorithms require painful operations such as computing a distance measure of all pairs of items. Shrayes Ramesh, data scientist at L-3 Data Tactics, will walk through the challenges and lessons he's learned when trying to cluster large-scale data distributed across many machines. </p> <p><br/><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>• 6:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>• 7:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>• 7:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>• 8:30pm -- Data Drinks (Tonic, 2036 G Street NW)</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>Unsupervised clustering is a useful approach to partitioning massive datasets into meaningful subpopulations. However, as data sets get larger, many traditional algorithms have difficultly scaling.  Here, I motivate the use of ensemble clustering as a scalable, robust approach to clustering at large, distributed datasets. The three components of ensemble clustering: (1) generating first-stage clusters, (2) aligning clustering output, and (3) aggregation and voting will be explained in a walkthrough demonstration and their nuances discussed. Finally, I will show some examples of clustering output and talk about extensions that can be made to the ensemble clustering framework that lend itself nicely to other modern unsupervised learning techniques.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p>Shrayes Ramesh is a Senior Data Scientist at L-3.

It is a means of seeing the forest for the trees, distilling and synthesizing the extant knowledge about a topic.</p> <p>Meta-analyses are mainly seen in the world of biomedical research, so interest is in ""treatments"", namely drugs  or particular diets or the like. However, ""treatments"" can mean a marketing campaign or a behavioral intervention (like spanking) or a change of a protocol. With that understanding, meta-analysis refers to the synthesis of results from several small but comparable studies to derive overall estimates of treatment effects that typically will be more robust and have higher statistical power. </p> <p>Classical meta-analysis involves studies looking at the same treatments to get an overall summary effect of one particular treatment effect. Network meta-analysis can be modeled to utilize indirect comparisons to compare the relative effectiveness of several different treatments of the same condition. In this presentation I will describe both classical and network meta-analysis, as well as the typical problems and biases one has to be aware of in doing meta-analyses. The computations and weighting schemes used in meta-analysis can have direct applications to implement a Divide-and-Conquer strategy so that modeling of large data sets can be done in chunks and the results combined to get valid results for the entire data set.

First, anomaly detection techniques are surveyed at a high level so that their shortcomings are exposed. The shortcomings are mainly their inflexibility in the use of a context ‘window’ size and/or their suboptimal performance in handling sequences. Furthermore, high-performing techniques for sequences are usually associated with their respective knowledge domains. After discussing these shortcomings, RNNs are exposed mathematically as generic sequence modelers that can handle sequences of arbitrary length. From there, results from experiments using RNNs show their ability to detect anomalies in a set of test sequences. The test sequences had different types of anomalies and unique normal behavior. Given the characteristics of the test data, it was concluded that the RNNs were not only able to generically distinguish rare values in the data (out of context) but were also able to generically distinguish abnormal patterns (in context).</p> <p> In addition to the anomaly detection work, a solution for reproducing computational research is described. The solution addresses reproducing compute applications based on Docker container technology as well as automating the infrastructure that runs the applications. By design, the solution allows the researcher to seamlessly transition from local (test) application execution to remote (production) execution because little distinction is made between local and remote execution. Such flexibility and automation allows the researcher to be more confident of results and more productive, especially when dealing with multiple machines. </p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p><br/><b><a href=""https://about.me/majidaldosari"">Majid Al-Dosari</a></b></p> <p><br/>Majid recently completed his (second) Master's degree in Computational Science from George Mason University.

IT professionals continue to struggle capturing, transforming, and analyzing these complex data structures mixed with traditional relational style datasets using conventional MPP and/or Hadoop infrastructures.  Public cloud infrastructures such as Amazon and Azure provide almost unlimited resources and scalability to handle both structured and semi-structured data (XML, JSON, AVRO) at Petabyte scale.  These new capabilities coupled with traditional data management access methods such as SQL allow organizations and businesses new opportunities to leverage analytics at an unprecedented scale while greatly simplifying data pipeline architectures and providing an alternative to the ""data lake"".</p> <p>

Please join DWDC and Snowflake Computing for a discussion of these topics and a demonstration of this game changing technology. The demonstration will focus on analyzing structured and semistructured together using a commercially available cloud based platform and standards based SQL language to provide insights on large petabytes scale data sets.</p> <p>

201,"<p>Please join us for an exciting talk by Dr. Alexandr ""Sasha"" Draganov about the mathematics behind prediction and mitigation of rare, catastrophic events. </p> <p><b>About the Talk</b></p> <p>How do we quantify risk that is associated with a financial instrument? Intuitively, risk is clearly connected to the probability of a loss.  In a simple case, we estimate the volatility; however, the dreadful experience of the recent financial crisis shows that volatility alone does not paint the full picture.  The common computation of volatility misses the possibility of rare but catastrophic events.  </p> <p><br/>One possible reason for this limitation is the overuse of the so-called normal probability distribution.  It is called ""normal"" for a reason: indeed, it is the most common way to characterize random variations (such as variations in the value of securities).  However, this tool must not be applied indiscriminately.  A deeper dive shows that it often fails for large, rare variations, precisely when there is a possibility of a failure.  </p> <p>This concept was popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who christened such events Black Swans.  Popular books notwithstanding, there is a real mathematical foundation today to deal with this problem.  Applications are common in the insurance industry (Hurricane Katrina) or for construction in the regions, where earthquakes are common. </p> <p>We have recently completed a DARPA-funded research program, where we applied these new ideas for engineering applications.  Using real data from various sensors, we were able to detect and mitigate outliers in real time.  In this presentation, we will review the concept and the science of rare, catastrophic events, and will talk about ways to alleviate their effects.</p> <p><b>Meetup Agenda</b></p> <p><br/>6:30 PM - Networking, Food &amp; Drink</p> <p>7:00 PM - Intro &amp; Talk</p> <p>Join us for more discussion after the event with Data Drinks (location TBD).</p> <p><b>Sponsors for this Event</b></p> <p>Thanks to <a href=""http://www.datacommunitydc.org/"">Data Community DC</a> for organizational support, to <a href=""https://www.contactually.com/"">Contactually</a> for space, and to <a href=""https://www.excella.com/careers"">Excella Consulting</a> for our food and drink.</p> <p><b>About Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Alexandr “Sasha” Draganov grew up in the Soviet Union, with a limited access to computers. When you cannot rely on a computer, you have to compensate by honing your math and analytical techniques. Today, Sasha uses these skills to do research and development in multiple fields, including applied mathematics, algorithm development, signal processing, and telecommunications. He authored winning proposals and served as the Principal Investigator for multimillion-dollar research and development programs. Sasha published over 40 papers, and presented at dozens of conferences. He holds five U.S. patents. He has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford and a Masters in Theoretical Physics from Kiev University, Ukraine.</p> <p>Sasha runs two start-up companies: one is performing contract research and development for government and commercial customers, and another is developing an innovative software application for personal finance.</p> <p>Sasha loves books. He got hooked on reading while serving 2 years in the Soviet military in a small town, where a local library was the only source of entertainment. He remembers a jolt from reading first few pages of Swann’s Way by Marcel Proust on the steps to a radar cabin. Proust remains one of favorite authors, as are Leo Tolstoy and Robert Musil.  Recently, Sasha published a scholarly article in a refereed journal on the idea of virtue in Tolstoy’s work.  Sasha also loves fine art and has visited many major art museums all over the world.</p>",Data Wranglers DC,How to Find and Mitigate Rare Catastrophic Events,1457566200000

Please RSVP <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Data-Education-DC/events/229613009/"">here</a> for this event. </b></p> <p>Have you ever wanted to scale R but are limited due to memory? In this talk Joseph Rickert, blogger, data scientist and R community Ambassador introduces the latest R technology to scale your data analysis.</p> <p>-- TALK OUTLINE --  </p> <p>Microsoft R Server (formerly Revolution R Enterprise) has become the foundation for Microsoft’s use or the R language to tackle big-data machine learning and predictive analytics tasks. At the heart of MRS is the RevoScaleR package that implements a number of parallel external memory algorithms. These “PEMAs” are inherently parallel and designed for distributed computing on large data sets. Unlike standard open source R functions they do not require all of the data to be in memory at one time. I will provide an overview of MRS and show some examples of PEMAs working on data sets too large to be processed by open source R algorithms on my laptop.</p> <p>-- SPEAKER --</p> <p>Joseph Rickert is a Program Manager and R Community Ambassador for Microsoft. He came to Microsoft with the rest of Revolution Analytics team where he worked as a data scientist, blog editor and special programs manager.  He is currently Microsoft’s representative to the R Consortium’s Infrastructure Steering Committee and a member of the organizing committee for useR!2016. </p> <p>Previously, Joe held a variety of technical and marketing roles while working for technology startups that spanned multiple industries from local area networks to disk drives, test equipment and health care. Joe entered Franklin &amp; Marshall college on a Classics scholarship and end up a Math major. He also earned an M.A. in Humanities and an M.S. in Statistics from the California State University.
