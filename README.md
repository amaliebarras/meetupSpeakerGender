#Analyzing Gender of Speakers at DC Tech + Data Meetups

This is a [Tech Lady Hackathon](http://techladyhackathon.org/) project. 

The goal is to look into the gender breakdown of speakers at DC Tech and Data Meetups. 

DC has a vibrant community of women in tech, as well as many tech + data meetups that can be great places to learn and network. To see how well women are represented in these meetups, we are collecting the last year speaker data for some of DC's largest tech and data meetups.

All data is collected from [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/).
